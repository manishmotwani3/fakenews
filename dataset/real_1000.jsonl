For years, marketers have been unable to see what organic and paid search terms users were entering, much less tie those searches to purchases. Jumpshot not only injects that user search visibility back into the market, but also makes it possible to tie those keywords to conversions -- for any web site. \n\n\"Ever since search engines encrypted search results, marketers have been in the dark about keywords, impacting not only the insight into their own search investments, but also their ability to unearth high converting keywords for their competitors,\" said Deren Baker, CEO of Jumpshot. \"Our platform eliminates the hacks, assumptions, and guesswork that marketers are doing now and provides real data: actual searches tied to actual conversions conducted by real people with nothing inferred.\" \n\nUnlike other keyword research tools that receive data through the Adwords API or send bots to cobble together various data inputs and implied metrics, Jumpshot leverages its panel of over 115 million global consumers to analyze real search activity. As a result, Jumpshot is able to provide companies with actionable data to improve the ROI of their search marketing campaigns, SEO tactics and content marketing initiatives. \n\nAvailable today, Jumpshot Elite provides 13 months of backward-looking data as well as: \n\nAccess to real queries used by searchers \n\nPaid and organic results for any website \n\nVisibility into organic keywords, eliminating the \"not provided\" outcome in web analytics \n\nReal user queries, clicks and transactions instead of machine-generated clicks with inferred results \n\nAbility to tie keywords to real transactions on any website \n\nVariable attribution models and lookback windows \n\nLaunched in January, 2015, Jumpshot grew out of the ambitions of a group of smart marketers and data scientists who were frustrated about the limitations of the data they had access to, and excited about the opportunity to provide new insights into online behavior. \n\nThe company uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online world for businesses, from where customers spend time online to what they do there and how they get from place to place. By tracking the online customer journey down to each click, Jumpshot reveals how and why customers arrive at purchase decisions. The company tracks more data in more detail than other services, tracking 160 billion monthly clicks generated by its extensive data panel. \n\nAbout Jumpshot \n\nJumpshot is a marketing analytics platform that reveals the entire customer journey -- from the key sources of traffic to a site, to browsing and buying behavior on any domain. With a panel of 115 million users, Jumpshot provides marketers with the insight to understand what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on their own site -- a scope of information never before attainable.

{"id":"ba44d0cd-bff2-4875-8036-86f37419b5e7","content":"Words kill or give life; they are usually either poison or good fruit. The words we speak are electromagnetic forces that usually reflect our inner attitude.  \n \nThey contain the power of death and life and ultimately influence the world around us. Augustus Woodbury once said, \u201cScientific men tell us that every sound upon the surface of our own and other planets circulates in endless and ceaseless waves through infinite space. Certainly not less subtle is the influence of our words upon the life and character of the world.\u201d We must always think about the influence of our words before we say them out; \u201cwhat is my objective in saying this.\u201d \u201cAre these words going to produce life or death.\u201d Proverbs 18:21 declares, \u201cDeath and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.\u201d \n \n\nAs a matter of fact, words are our input in someone else\u2019s life. We must make sure our input gives life and not death. We are actually responsible for the impact we have on others and our communities in general. \n \nAs responsible citizens, we must intensify our awareness of the input we have on other people\u2019s lives. Actually, one person can change the course of another person\u2019s life with the power of words. Individual dreams and visions have been aborted because of words of death spoken over them. Homes and marriages have been destroyed because of poisonous words. Companies and businesses have fallen because of words of envy and jealousy. People have lost their jobs because of lying words said about them. We should always be conscious of the life-changing power of our words. \n \n\nProverbs 19:1 says, \u201cBetter is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.\u201d We must use wisdom when we speak, by checking our motives, attitudes and choice of words. We must divorce negative patterns of thinking and bring life to others with our words. Words are influencers. One of the best ways we can use words to influence others, is to practice telling the truth. \n \nWe are living in the world where too often people try to influence others with manipulation, false flattery and deception and spin doctoring. The truth creates trust, which in turn generates influence. The other way we can put our words to good use, is to choose to use words that build in our speech, rather than words that tear down people and society. \n \n\nWe should use our words to build other people up, to inspire, encourage and empower, to affirm and bless. Positive words yield positive influence. It is wisdom to refuse to speak words that belittle and demoralise other people around us. When we make a choice of speaking well of others, in-spite of their short comings, then we will have a healthy and far reaching positive influence with our words. \n \nIf we spread malicious gossip, we are poisoning our own future and sabotaging our own influence with others. King Solomon of ancient Israel said, \u201cWhen a leader listens to malicious gossip, all the workers get infested with evil\u201d (Proverbs 29:12, the message Bible). We must use the influence of our words to bring peace in conflicting situations. \n \n\nDue to the fact that many people have no understanding of the power of their words, they have caused themselves and others unnecessary pain and hardships. Each and every day our actions and our words impact those around us. \n \nThe question is, how are we influencing others with our words and actions? One of the best ways we can influence each other is by inspiring, motivating and encouraging each other by what we say. The story is told about how Sugar Ray Robinson changed the course of one girl\u2019s life, Flo-Jo. \n \nWhen narrating her life story Flo-Jo said, \u201cSugar Ray looked at me in the eye and told me, it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, what the colour of your skin is, or what odds are against you. All that matters is that you have a dream and you commit yourself to that dream. Do that and it will happen.\u201d She continued and said, \u201cRight then and there, I was sold out. I was just eight years old but I was fired up about what my future could be.\u201d \n \n\nWith words, Sugar Ray Robinson, one of the outstanding boxing champs inspired a great change in one girls\u2019 life. Words are powerful, they can inspire those around us to greatness. They can bring hope to the hopeless, courage to the discouraged, comfort and healing to the oppressed. We must speak life to our husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, our communities and nation. \n \nPaul\u2019s wise advice to the Ephesians is appropriate at this juncture, \u201cLet no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.\u201d (Ephesians 4:29). By our words we can build the nation and by our words we can destroy the nation.","title":"THE INFLUENCE OF OUR WORDS","media-type":"News","source":"Times of Swaziland","published":"2015-09-28T23:21:00Z"}

With the iPhone, the company added a feature called 3D Touch, which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The Apple TV got its first big upgrade in more than three years with a more powerful chip and a redesigned remote control. Apple's family of iPads also gained a bigger sibling with the iPad Pro, a tablet with a 12.9-inch screen \u2014 much larger than the older 9.7-inch iPad.\n\nAt the event, I tried out the new products in a demonstration booth. Here are some first impressions: iPhone\n\nThe 3D Touch capability is the iPhone's signature new feature. Pressing down on the screen starts different actions, depending on how much force is exerted.\n\nA light press on an email, for example, shows a preview of the message, and a hard press then opens the email. You can also press down hard on an app icon to open shortcuts to different actions \u2014 for example, pushing down on the Instagram app shows a list of next steps, including the ability to create a new post. When you press down hard, the device responds with a tapping sensation.\n\nI found the new iPhones pretty straightforward to use. The 3D Touch feature is easy to get used to, and I quickly figured out how to create a new calendar appointment by pressing down hard on the calendar app icon.\n\nThe new smartphones are also slightly thicker and heavier than their predecessors, though I confess I noticed that only after reading the specifications on Apple's website and not when holding the devices. iPad\n\nThe iPad Pro's jumbo screen obviously gives more room for content to breathe, but interacting with it still feels the same as with older iPad tablets.\n\nThe iPad Pro is capable of running two full-size iPad apps on the screen at the same time. The previous iPad Air 2 could run two apps at the same time, but with a primary app taking up a larger portion of the screen.\n\nThe large device will be familiar to most because apart from its size, it works the same as previous versions of the tablet. The big-screen iPad also felt comfortable to hold. It weighs about 680 grams, which is the same weight as the very first iPad. Apple TV\n\nThe Apple TV is significantly different from past models. The software interface has a white background and vivid colours, similar to Apple's Music app. The new remote control includes a touch pad for scrolling around the menu and a microphone for finding things to watch using Siri, Apple's voice assistant. The remote also includes motion sensors for gaming.\n\nI decided to have some fun by asking Siri to help me navigate content on Apple TV. For example, I tried using Siri to steer a spaceship in a Star Wars game. But that was difficult, perhaps because of my inexperience with the game.\n\nI also tried searching for action movies and comedy movies with the remote control's microphone. Siri misunderstood me when I said \"comedy,\" thinking I had said \"comity.\" But it did a better job with action movies \u2014 when I said \"show me action movies,\" Siri brought up a list of titles including Mad Max and Furious 7.\n\nThe new remote control is thicker than the previous one, and in this case, that's a good thing. The previous Apple TV remote was so thin that it had a tendency to disappear between couch cushions.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nFollow Digital Life on Twitter The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"Hands on with Apple's iPhone 6s, iPad Pro and Apple TV","media-type":"News","source":"South Coast Register","published":"2015-09-10T03:25:04Z"}

Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nWhat will happen to her husband, long-serving Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, is less clear. \n \nMs Credlin\u00a0worked for Malcolm Turnbull during his stint as\u00a0opposition leader in 2008-09, but the pair did not always see eye to eye and she will not\u00a0be\u00a0working for the incoming leader. \n\nAfter her time with Mr Turnbull, Ms Credlin became the\u00a0dominant figure in the Abbott government,\u00a0described as a controlling co-prime minister by her critics, lauded by her allies \u2014\u00a0not least Mr Abbott, who called her the \"fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with\". \u00a0As chief of staff, she became one of the most high-profile\u00a0staffers in recent political\u00a0history. \n \nFrom the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Peta Credlin was in the room as one of his most trusted lieutenants. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nFrom the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Ms Credlin was in the room as one of the opposition leader's most trusted lieutenants alongside press secretaries and advisers Andrew Hirst\u00a0and\u00a0Claire Kimball, honing and refining\u00a0Mr Abbott's laser-like attack on Kevin Rudd's carbon pollution reduction scheme. \n\nAfter just less than\u00a0four years in opposition,\u00a0 in September 2013, Ms Credlin, a lawyer with years of experience in the Howard government,\u00a0made the transition as chief of staff into government. \n\nBut the tightly controlled approach adopted in\u00a0opposition\u00a0did not work\u00a0as smoothly in government. \n \nMr Abbott and Ms Credlin in 2013. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nPublic complaints about a \" command and control \" approach taken by the prime minister's office quickly surfaced, and a reliance on slogans that worked in opposition did not cut through in government. \n\nIn February 2015, when Mr Abbott faced a spill motion in the party room, some MPs were calling for a shake-up of the prime minister's office, and for\u00a0political veteran Tony Nutt to be brought into the office. \n\nMs Credlin disappeared from public view, for a time, but the complaints soon resurfaced. \n \nBrian Loughnane has been federal director of the Liberal Party since 2003. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  \n  \nBut Mr Abbott refused suggestions of change to his office: in his farewell speech, he\u00a0singled out his chief of staff \u00a0\"who has been unfairly maligned by people who\u00a0should've\u00a0known better\". \n\nAnd now, both exit the political centre stage, at least for a time. \n\nMr\u00a0Loughnane, meanwhile, has been federal director of the Liberal Party since February 2003 and party strategists told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that, if possible, he should continue in the role. \n\nOne veteran pointed out that Mr Turnbull and Mr Loughnane had worked together before, during Mr Turnbull's stint as opposition leader,\u00a0and that a change in director was not \"necessary or inevitable\". \n\nThat veteran also said the prime minister's office would likely benefit from a bit of \"competitive tension\" between it and Liberal Party HQ. \n\n\"It depends on the relationship between the two of them;\u00a0[Mr Loughnane] has served every\u00a0leader\u00a0since Howard.     \u00a0But Malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director \u2013 you can't have a situation like [former prime minister]\u00a0Paul Keating and [former ALP secretary] Gary Gray [in 1996].\" \n\nA second Liberal veteran said Ms Credlin was \"very talented and a good manager, but it will be hard for her to stay in the show. I do hope Brian stays on.\u00a0The most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience.\" \n\nFairfax Media sought comment from Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane. \n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team. \n\nThe former secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and of the Communications Department,\u00a0Drew Clarke, will serve as his\u00a0acting chief of staff, while Mr Nutt,\u00a0who worked closely with Turnbull backer Senator Arthur Sinodinos\u00a0in the office of John Howard,\u00a0will return to Canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership. \n\nSenator Sinodinos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Turnbull would seek to emulate the attitude\u00a0of Mr\u00a0Howard as prime minister by taking a team approach,\u00a0\"and\u00a0have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it's an open prime minister's office, it's accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister,\" he told Sky News. \n\n\"The role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off;\u00a0the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns. \n\n\"You don't need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on.\" \n\nFollow James Massola on Facebook . \n\nFollow us on Twitter","title":"What will happen to Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane, Liberal power couple?","media-type":"News","source":"Brisbane Times","published":"2015-09-15T06:04:06Z"}

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \n\nAn email chain between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus from January and February 2009 is raising questions about whether some of the emails on Clinton's private email server were mistakenly deemed personal and not included among the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the State Department. \n\nSeparately on Friday, a State Department official said a \"small number\" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the House committee investigating the 2012 terror attack had been discovered. \n\nIn the past few days, the State Department was contacted by the Department of Defense about the Clinton-Petraeus chain, two State Department officials said. The officials say the chain does not appear to include classified information, though an official determination has not been made. The chain included Clinton and Petraeus getting acquainted as well as some personnel matters, according to the officials. It was apparently considered personal by Clinton's team and therefore wasn't turned over to the State Department, the officials said. \n\nMost of the email chain was on an old email server Clinton says she no longer has access to, but the end of the email chain contained messages on the private server she used while in office, according to another official. The chain begins on January 10, 2009 and ends on Feb. 1, 2009 and contains less than 10 emails total between Clinton and Petraeus, the official said. \n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said State received \"several copies of one email chain between former Secretary Clinton and then Commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the Department\" from the Department of Defense and the State Inspector General. \"These emails are now in our possession and will be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests.

He was named to the All-Star team four times in 13 seasons and helped the Cardinals win the 1982 World Series, posting a 2-0 record against the Milwaukee Brewers in the Fall Classic, including a victory in Game 7. \n\nIn 1984 and 1985, Andujar won 20 and 21 games and finished fourth in the National League Cy Young Award voting both years.

A new school record \n \nPrairie View A&M was trailing 27-3 with a couple seconds remaining in the first quarter, facing a 3rd-and-15 on Texas State\u2019s 43 yard-line. The Panthers punted in order to pin the Bobcats in their own territory, but their plan was foiled by Brandon McDowell, sophomore cornerback. \n \nMcDowell fielded the punt and found some space to make a play. The sophomore ran past a couple of Panthers and all of a sudden a lane opened up for him. McDowell broke some tackles, and ankles, and took the punt across the field for a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown. McDowell is behind Brandon Smith, senior wide receiver, for punt returns, but after a return like this, Smith might be looking over his shoulder. \n \n2. Second chance \n \nIt took 88 seconds for Texas State to get on the board. Another touchdown followed less than two minutes later. The opportunity was created because Damani Alexcee, junior safety, forced a fumble that Trey McGowan, senior linebacker, recovered at Texas State\u2019s 39-yard line. The fumble recovery opened up the game entirely by gifting another possession to the Bobcats. \n \n3. Back on track \n \nRobert Lowe, senior running back, scored the first touchdown of the game with 13:32 remaining in the first quarter. The touchdown was set up by a 49-yard completion to Jafus Gains, senior wide receiver, that put the team on the five-yard line. This drive set the tone for the rest of the game as Texas State showed their dominance all night over Prairie View A&M. Lowe rushed to the left side with ease and gave Texas State a 7-0 lead. \n \n4. Bowling ball \n \nOn third 3rd-and-3 in the redzone, Texas State went to Chris Nutall, senior running back. Nutall did enough to get the first down but he found more running room and took his carry into the end zone for six points. Nutall\u2019s score gave Texas State a 14-0 lead with 9:54 left in the first quarter. All hopes of an upset for Prairie View A&M were diminishing after the score. The drive was the Bobcats\u2019 second of the game and their high powered offense was on display early on in the game. \n \n5. Going long \n \nThe play started off looking like an option play with Tyler Jones, junior quarterback, but he pulled back from the option. Smith was wide-open in the secondary. The senior wide receiver hauled in the pass from Jones and the Panthers secondary was nowhere in sight. Smith took the catch for a 65-yard touchdown. The touchdown gave the team a 20-0 lead in the game. It was the first of three passing touchdowns for Jones.","title":"Five key plays from Texas State's home opener","media-type":"News","source":"University Star","published":"2015-09-13T03:36:40Z"}

Anyone with sober mind will be horrified and left wondering on how and when these politicians are going to fulfil these pledges. \n\nIt seems also that even those who are defending their seats have forgotten that in 2010 they issued a lot of promises majority of which they have not accomplished. They now go out to dish out even more promises.\u00a0 \n\nWhile Mwalimu Nyerere used to tell Tanzanians that they will develop only through hard work, our candidates are competing to show that they have solutions to all problems and these solutions do not entail people working, let alone working hard, to resolve their problems. \n\nCandidates are promising each and everything but none of them have been heard telling Tanzanians that they will have to toil for them to earn their daily bread. \n\nMaking promises to the effect that people will not be required to work in order to better their lives amounts to making them complacent. And this will not only affect the individuals but the entire nation. For the nation to make strides it needs hard working people who will be able to first change their personal lives and then contribute for the national economy. \n\nCrave for victory should not blind the candidates and push them to give promises which in actual fact are not reasonable.

So, there is no point in cheating the public that gas will provide enough money for implementation of these many plans which we are hearing. \n\nPoliticians should campaign knowing that this country or its people are not going to end tomorrow.

The Research and Hope Awards recognize the men and women conducting groundbreaking research, giving back to their community, advocating for patients and bringing awareness to particular diseases. This year, the awards honored those who are changing the world of oncology research and care. As we continue to gain new insight into the many variations of cancer, new tools are created, medicines are developed and new treatments emerge. With the help of dedicated individuals like the 2015 Research and Hope honorees, we move a little bit closer to transforming once-devastating diseases into manageable conditions.\n\nhttps:\/\/photos.prnewswire.com\/prnvar\/20150915\/266923\n\nThis year's recipient of the Excellence in Biopharmaceutical Research award was the KEYTRUDA Team from Merck & Co., Inc. This team developed an approved treatment for advanced melanoma and it has the potential to treat many other types of cancer. We look forward to seeing the continued development of their breakthrough work.\n\nJ. Silvio Gutkind, Ph.D., professor, Department of Pharmacology; associate director, Basic Science, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, is this year's recipient of the award for Excellence in Academic or Governmental Research. His extensive work with G proteins ultimately led to novel strategies for treating and preventing many types of cancer. These advances have the potential to save the lives of many patients in years to come.\n\nThe Community Champion Award went to Rick Dunetz, executive director and founder of the Side-Out Foundation. Rick, a local volleyball coach, invited his mother to work with his team after her breast cancer diagnosis. She found hope in their victories and the team was inspired to win not only for themselves, but for her as well. After seeing the transformation of his mother and his team, Rick founded the Side-Out Foundation to reach other athletes and cancer patients. His work is bringing hope and energy to the cause of ending breast cancer.\n\nVicki Kennedy, co-founder and president of the Board of the ; senior counsel, Greenberg Traurig LLP, was this year's recipient of the Award for Excellence in Advocacy and Activism. Since the passing of her late husband, Senator Ted Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy has spoken publicly on coping with stress and enhancing quality of life for brain tumor patients and their loved ones. Her dedication to telling her story, and the story of thousands of other families whose lives have been impacted by cancer is inspiring to many.\n\nThe recipients of the Visibility and Progress Award are Liz and Jay Scott, co-founders of Alex's Lemonade Stand. In 2000, their four-year-old daughter, Alex, founded Alex's Lemonade Stand to raise money to find a cure for childhood cancer after her own diagnosis. Following Alex's death in 2004, her parents set up the foundation to continue her dream of finding a cure. Since Alex's first stand in 2000, the foundation has raised more than $100 million to fund more than 475 cutting-edge research projects. Alex's spirit of determination and hope lives on through the foundations work.\n\nThese five awardees are just a few of the individuals doing outstanding work in the field of oncology research.

LOUIS , Sept. 18, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ --\u00a0Attorneys from the Houston and Kansas City offices of the Potts Law Firm, LLP , have filed a new lawsuit against auto manufacturing giant General Motors LLC (NYSE: GM) in St. Louis City Circuit Court on behalf of 90 individual victims of a deadly ignition switch defect that led to the recall of more than 28 million GM vehicles worldwide and has caused more than 120 deaths and thousands of injuries. \n\nThe new claims for serious injuries and wrongful death follow this week's announcement that GM will pay a $900 million criminal settlement as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. Department of Justice for misleading the government and the public about the company's handling of the faulty ignition switches. \n\nThe Potts Law Firm represents hundreds of individuals and their families in lawsuits against GM in Missouri courts and other jurisdictions across the U.S. The new claims filed in St. Louis allege that the GM ignition switches caused vehicles to shut off while being driven, prevented protective airbags from inflating, and caused seatbelts to malfunction. The new filing is Patricia Foreman , et al. v. General Motors LLC . Overall, the firm represents nearly 150 ignition switch victims in St. Louis . \n\nAccomplished trial attorney and Potts Law Firm Managing Partner Derek Potts represents the families of Tabatha Rogers , 26, and Tara Yates , 27, who died in 2014 when their car unexpectedly careened off a level stretch of highway. Their case is tentatively set for trial in January 2016 in St. Louis . \n\nMs. Rogers lost control of her 2001 Pontiac Grand Am on the day after Valentine's Day on old State Highway 35 in Sevier County, Tennessee . The car hit an embankment before becoming airborne and striking a utility pole. Ms. Rogers died at the scene and Ms. Yates died shortly after at a nearby hospital. Mr. Potts says he plans to prove that a faulty GM ignition switch caused the fatal crash. \n\n\"We believe the evidence clearly shows that these young women would still be here today if not for an ignition switch that General Motors knew was defective,\" says Mr. Potts. \"It is extremely telling that airbags in their car didn't inflate at any point despite this violent, fatal wreck.\" \n\nThe Houston -based Potts Law Firm represents clients in a variety of personal injury claims and mass tort matters, from complex pharmaceutical cases to automobile defect cases to product liability claims. The firm currently is accepting new GM ignition switch cases and referrals.

{"id":"15d96c82-1705-431f-83ca-bac60a6efcf5","content":"Factional unanimity in the ALP could facilitate any move to dump Bill Shorten as leader. Source: AAP Australians woke to a new Prime Minister on Tuesday morning and feedback from opinion pollsters has been coming in thick and fast. The new incumbent, Malcolm Turnbull, is preferred by up to 70 per cent of voters according to the Morgan Poll and by a staggering 94 per cent of Coalition voters according to ReachTEL.\n\nTurnbull is opposed by a somewhat stressed Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who is supported as alternative prime minister by only 24 per cent of voters, according to Morgan, with more than a quarter of ALP voters preferring Turnbull as PM.\n\nNo wonder Shorten wants to meet Turnbull to discuss the China free-trade agreement \u2014 he\u2019s probably after a joint shot for his campaign brochure.\n\nEven more tellingly, ReachTEL shows a clear majority of Greens voters \u2014 the ones supposed to deliver 90 per cent of their prefer\u00adences to Labor \u2014 support Turnbull over Shorten.\n\nThis majority support for Turnbull from Greens voters came in a poll held after Turnbull was politically mugged on the way to Yarralumla and forced to hand control of waterways to the Nationals, a move that will cost votes for Nationals candidates at the next election, leading to more of their state and federal seats progressively being knocked off by challenges from Labor, the Greens and independents.\n\nReachTEL also estimates that the election of Turnbull as PM means the swing in Western Australia\u2019s Canning by-election today should be about minus 5 per cent, instead of the 10 per cent predicted by all polls before the leadership spill.\n\nA week ago, an upset Labor win in Canning was possible and this result would have been consistent with the seat\u2019s former position as an ALP marginal during the Hawke and Keating years.\n\nA 5 per cent swing against the Coalition would equal the personal support attracted by Canning\u2019s former Liberal MP, the late Don Randall, suggesting the Liberals effectively retained all of their party vote.\n\nThat in turn would imply the Howard battlers are firmly in the grip of the Coalition 12 months out from the next election, in Canning and comparable seats across the country, such as Lindsay in NSW or Longman in Queensland.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by a ReachTEL national poll showing a two-party preferred vote of 50 per cent for the Turnbull-led Coalition, with a Galaxy poll showing 51 per cent. This is an increase of 4 per cent to 5 per cent over the figures under Tony Abbott, and I suspect the Coalition\u2019s standing will improve \u00adfurther, given the former prime minister\u2019s net dissatisfaction scores and the likely positive scores for Turnbull.\n\nA rough guide to the impact of Abbott on his party vote can be obtained by dividing his net dissatisfaction scores by about five, and this corresponds to an interim sugar hit to the Coalition vote of about 6 per cent.\n\nHow long the hit lasts depends to some extent on how quickly disaffected conservatives in the Coalition stop sabotaging the new PM before he has had a chance to save their seats from their own poor judgment. It would help if Turnbull\u2019s backers stopped provoking Abbott loyalists by boasting about their hatchet job on the ousted PM as this is a story that appeals to political insiders but not to voters.\n\nCheering on yesterday\u2019s men among the conservatives is yesterday\u2019s man for the ALP, Shorten, who less than a week ago was cruising to a certain victory for Labor with about 54 per cent of the two-party preferred despite net satisfaction ratings almost as bad as those of Abbott.\n\nComplacency on the part of Labor and the timidity of its leadership left the party reliant on the visceral dislike of Abbott among key groups to insulate Labor from the Greens in the ALP\u2019s inner-city seats and to make gains in marginal urban seats, especially in Victoria and South Australia.\n\nThis strategy became redundant within 24 hours of Abbott\u2019s demise as many of the middle-class and professional voters Shorten thought were in the bag switched their support to the new Turnbull government. Now Shorten is Turnbull\u2019s greatest asset and the Prime Minister should do everything he can to ensure the Opposition Leader survives until the next election.\n\nMy profiles of elections back to 1966 make it clear that Labor gains broad-based community support when it develops credible economic and social policies for working families in provincial cities and outer suburbs, and for middle-class families in marginal urban seats. Labor has been able to build on this foundation and go on to win elections when it has chosen leaders capable of articulating these policies during an extended period of opposition and making them relevant to key groups in marginal seats.\n\nShorten\u2019s insipid leadership means Labor has done neither \u2014 and now it may be too late.\n\nThe party\u2019s first problem is the rules put in place by Kevin Rudd to protect the leader from caucus challenges. If Shorten\u2019s net satisfaction scores don\u2019t improve and the ALP\u2019s vote begins to decline towards 45 per cent, Labor will be looking to dump him as quickly and as quietly as possible. But the rule changes make it potentially harder \u2014 unless there\u2019s a complete agreement across all the factions to ignore the rules, in effect, and let the caucus get on with it.\n\nThis means a challenge could become a protracted and public fight, which would hurt Labor\u2019s vote even further. If the factions agreed Shorten had to go, his replacement would be difficult to find as the factional gene pool in the ALP is so shallow, there are no natural leaders who seem capable of dominating Turnbull in parliamentary or public debates.\n\nEven with a competent leader, Labor and the union movement have a long-running problem in rebuilding the support base they once had among skilled blue-collar men in Labor\u2019s safer urban seats and in outer urban marginals such as Canning.\n\nTo become PM you need to be able to control a majority of seats on the floor of the House of Representatives, and it helps to win more than 50 per cent of the vote, but you don\u2019t need it if you can win more than 50 per cent of the votes in more than half the seats.\n\nIf you win the votes in the right seats the swing pendulum also becomes meaningless because it\u2019s \u00adreally only a retrospective device to measure what happened and does not predict what can happen.\n\nIn 1998, the ALP needed a two-party preferred swing of about 4 per cent to win a majority of seats on the pendulum and it actually managed a swing of 5.1 per cent, yet that left it still needing a swing of 0.8 per cent to win. This is because winning votes in your opponents\u2019 key seats reshuffles the seats along the pendulum even if the swing doesn\u2019t change.\n\nJohn Howard achieved this in 1998 by winning support from traditional Labor-voting welfare recipients and skilled blue-collar tradies in seats such as Canning.\n\nProfiling of elections back to 1966 shows that the Labor vote from tradies trended downwards from 1980 and split about 50-50 between Labor and the Coalition in 2004. The tradies profile for Labor bounced back a little in 2007 and 2010, but once more split 50-50 in 2013.\n\nShould that remain the case next year, the Coalition is likely to continue to maintain a lead of about 6 per cent among men.\n\nThe decline in support for the ALP among blue-collar men during the 1980s and 90s was counterbalanced by an increase in the ALP vote among women.\n\nThe female ALP vote rose in proportion to the increase in women\u2019s workforce participation rates, which went up from 34 per cent in 1961 to 53 per cent in 1993.\n\nThe two-party preferred ALP vote among women pulled ahead of the equivalent figure for men in the early 80s, with many crossing to Labor via the Australian Democrats. The ALP\u2019s primary vote from women is now consistently about six points ahead of its primary vote from men. Politically this means that, since 2001, you would be likelier to find a safe Labor seat dominated by female clerks than by male tradies, and you would be just as likely to find a Labor seat dominated by female professionals as male tradies.\n\nThis increased participation in the workforce by clerical and professional women has had a big pay-off for unions. Just as Labor\u2019s power base became more feminised and shifted its centre of gravity from traditional outer urban seats to move closer to the goat cheese circle, so too did the power base for the union movement.\n\nWhile the proportion of male union members in the private sector continues to decline, the proportion of female union members in the public sector has remained steady, although it temporarily rose in tandem with Rudd and Wayne Swan\u2019s stimulus in 2009.\n\nPublic sector jobs in administration, education and health are keeping the union movement afloat, and these three industries in both sectors now account for 52 per cent of all union members.\n\nThese workers have been easily persuaded by their union officials to support quotas for union members in hospitals and schools, and this focus on membership growth rather than outcomes for patients and students requires a lot of public spending and commensurately higher taxes, which of course hit private sector blue-collar jobs for blokes.\n\nThis is why Labor was incapable of cutting public spending under Rudd and Julia Gillard, and why the ACTU has been desperate to secure the election of another big-spending Labor government under a weak leader who considers themselves to be dependent on union support.\n\nThe evidence, however, shows that although more than half of the extra million jobs created by Labor were in public administration, education and health, there was no political return for Rudd in 2013 in terms of bigger swings to Labor from electorates containing larger numbers of voters working in these industries.\n\nLabor\u2019s lead among female voters comes from the seats domin\u00adated by the 50 per cent of employed women in full-time jobs. They voted Labor in 2013 and swung to Labor, irrespective of their industry or union membership. The other 50 per cent of working women in the more vulnerable part-time jobs live in the aspirational middle-class seats that voted strongly for the Coalition and swung to Abbott.\n\nThese tend to be the women who temporarily have given up full-time work to have children and who are seeking to re-enter the workforce by juggling childcare and effective marginal tax rates to help pay off a family mortgage and send their children to the best school they can afford.\n\nThey have high levels of debt and spending, and they tend to cluster in similarly priced housing estates in marginal seats. They were political gold when I first profiled them in the early 70s and they are still political gold in the present undernourished Labor market.\n\nThe challenge for Turnbull in selecting his new ministry is primarily to protect his base vote among Howard battlers.\n\nHe can do this by selecting an industrial relations minister who can relate directly to blue-collar working men, and a welfare minister who doesn\u2019t poke sticks at the huge numbers of welfare recipients clustered in outer urban and provincial seats, as these voters don\u2019t consider living in relative poverty as an entitlement.\n\nTo regain a degree of parity among middle-class and professional women, Turnbull clearly needs to select more of them as members of his cabinet \u2014 including women who understand what it\u2019s like to hand over a crying toddler at the childcare centre or comb the headlice out of their four-year-old after kindy, all to pay off the mortgage, save for school fees and help provide a better life for their families.\n\nIf he can do that, balance the budget and generate 220,000 jobs a year, winning the next election against whoever is leading the ALP at the time should be a cinch.\n\nI wish him well. However you vote at present, given the state of our economy and our labour \u00admarket, we all need Turnbull to succeed.\n\nJohn Black, a former Labor senator for Queensland, is chief executive of Australian Development Strategies, a demographic profiling company.

Have you ever felt like trading in the politically correct strictures of our modern day office environment for the world of Mad Men? It still exists, apparently, if you are a Melbourne barrister.\n\nThat was the gist of a very non-PC marketing campaign by the trouble-prone financial services shop, IOOF.\n\nA male adviser at its subsidiary, Shadforth Financial Group, sent the email soliciting for financial planning business from Melbourne's barrister community.\n\nAccording to an article in Lawyers Weekly, it had a very specific idea about who our \"typical barrister\" is. Let's just say that the girls and boys have very specific roles.\n\nAccording to the article, \"After marrying their 'school sweetheart' in their 30s, he suggested barristers in their 40s are likely to find themselves in the following position \u2013 'Your wife is a 'home engineer', managing two children under 10, and you are finding the 'cottage' which was never quite finished is becoming a little crowded'.\"\n\nThings are better by the time this archetypal barrister hits his 50s. His career is established and \"your wife has gone back to part-time work and the money flow is good for a while\".\n\nThe report said several barristers had complained about this stereotype of a very male Bar with stay-at-home wives.\n\n\"Are we not thrust back to the beginnings of Mad Men?\" an anonymous QC told the publication.\n\nA Shadforth\u200b spokesperson told Lawyers Weekly: \"This does not reflect the view of Shadforth\u200b and is not the Shadforth\u200b way.\"\n\nIt won't be help Shadforth's\u200b parent, IOOF, which needs all the legal help it can get. The ASX-listed company has faced a Senate grilling, and an investigation from ASIC over allegations of front running, insider trading and faulty research reports. Degree of pain \n\nCBD would like to admit that we might have been a tad unappreciative of just what the Hawke-Keating era minister, John Dawkins, achieved during his all-too brief stint chairing education dunce, Vocation.\n\nMuch has been written about the disastrous unravelling of its business, and carnage for investors who were flogged the stock at more than $3 a pop. It is now worth 10\u00a2.\n\nGood thing they have the luxury of three different class actions at their disposal.\n\nBut they should have known better. The risks were all reported in the previous annual report signed by Dawkins, according to his replacement in the chair, Doug Halley.\n\nIn this year's report, Halley referred to last year's effort saying: \"Our annual report also referred to risks that might restrict Vocation's ability to deliver on its strategy. With hindsight, two of these risks \u2013 the company's dependence on the support of government funding, and damage to its brand \u2013 were prescient.\"\n\nThat is one way of putting it.\n\nThere is some good news for investors. The new chief executive, Stewart Cummins, said he plans new initiatives to get the company back on track like, \"build a strong management team\" and upgrade its systems \"to provide accurate management information\".\n\nWow, why didn't they think of this before the IPO in December 2013.\n\nThe most sobering information is that the company paid out a $9.5 million dividend pre IPO, and another $6.5 million in 2014.\n\nThat is $16 million in cash dividends for a company now worth $23 million. NAB's Poach \n\nASIC's national media manager, Andre Khoury, will be playing on the other side of the fence, taking up a position with NAB next month.\n\nBut NAB confirmed that he will not be working with its wealth boss, Andrew Hagger.\n\nIt is an important point given Hagger has been moonlighting for ASIC thanks to the bank's wealth fiasco.\n\nIn March this year, a Senate committee heard how Hagger has had to check no fewer than five ASIC media releases that had been sent to the bank in draft form.\n\n\"Our practice of sending media releases to external entities has been that, with a negotiated outcome \u2013 and only with a negotiated outcome such as an Enforceable Undertaking \u2013 ASIC will generally provide the party with our media release shortly ahead of publication,\" explained Khoury's current boss, Greg Medcraft\u200b. Fat loss\n\nSingaporean dotcom \"incubator\" Fatfish\u200b Group came back to the market with a Plan B on Tuesday after its investors gave it a lesson in democracy last week. They unceremoniously dumped its plan to spin-off, and list, mobile phone game maker, iCandy.\n\nFatfish\u200b said that, after consulting with iCandy's\u200b board, the ASX, and its own investors, it remains \"committed to pursuing the proposed spin-off and listing\" of iCandy\u200b.\n\nTo avoid another rejection by shareholders at the next meeting, it proposes to retain a larger stake in iCandy\u200b and distribute fewer shares to its shareholders.\n\nMind you, its investors might have been reacting to the restatement of Fatfish's accounts last week by its auditors from MSI Ragg Weir.\n\nIt appears the backdoor listing of the Fatfish business in July last year, via Atech Holdings, did not meet certain accounting standards.\n\nThis means the purchase of one particular Fatfish\u200b business should have been accounted for as a cost rather than as \"goodwill on acquisition\".\n\nThis basically doubled the company's net loss for the year ending December 31, 2014, from $6.5 million to $12.5 million. It reported revenue of $507,310 for that year.\n\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"It's a Mad world at the Melbourne Bar, as long as you're a man","media-type":"News","source":"Daily Liberal","published":"2015-09-22T14:15:00Z"}
{"id":"e9c9d2d9-a5f0-45fa-89ca-bf8470bf87c6","content":"The leader of Iran's legislature has definite views on his country's nuclear deal with world powers. \n\nAli Larijani says the agreement is good enough. He adds that United States' reading of that deal, particularly when it comes to sanctions, is not good at all. And he's hoping that the agreement brings change in his country \u2014 though not as much as many Iranians would want. \n\nThe lawmaker expressed those views to NPR during a visit to New York. While he is not one of the clerics who hold ultimate power in Iran, he is a consummate insider. He was a top national security official before his election to parliament. His brother leads the judiciary, and the family has important business interests. He is considered a true conservative in his country, and his views open a window into Iran's complex governing elite. \n\nLarijani supported the negotiations that led to the agreement, which places limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of global economic sanctions. He called the final terms \"acceptable.\" \n\n\"I believe that we can use this deal as a step we can take to move forward. And at the same time, it is not flawless,\" he said. \n\nIndeed, Larijani expects lawmakers in Iran's sometimes contentious assembly to complain. \n\nCritics In The Iranian Legislature  \n\nThe assembly speaker met with NPR at a New York hotel. He was dressed in a suit and no tie, in the style of the Islamic Republic. He's in his 50s, old enough to recall all the years from the 1979 Islamic revolution to this historic moment. \n\nHe has held positions in the revolutionary government since its early years. He now leads a legislature that, like Larijani himself, is considered conservative. He says many lawmakers are skeptical of the deal. \n\nHe pointed to provisions he considered unequal. The U.S., for example, can make sanctions snap back into place if it thinks Iran breaks the deal. \n\n\"But that is not true for us. We cannot return to the situation that we were in the past,\" he said. \n\nLarijani sees many of Iran's concessions \u2014 like removing the core of a reactor \u2013 as permanent. \n\nHis concerns are the opposite of those voiced by American critics. U.S. skeptics worry Iran is temporarily setting back its nuclear program to get out of sanctions forever; Iranians argue they're setting back their program for sanctions relief that may be temporary. \n\nLarijani's anxiety was evident in our conversation. \"If something ... happens in the U.S. Congress, or if there are new types of sanctions on us, then they should not expect us to go \u2014 to implement. Or if the Americans don't stay true to their obligations on their part, they shouldn't expect us to do it.\" \n\nHis remark pointed to one of the sticky points in this agreement. \n\nIt's designed to lift nuclear sanctions against Iran. \n\nThe U.S. says it offers Iran no assurances about sanctions imposed for non-nuclear issues. \n\nU.S. Says Sanctions Remain An Option  \n\nThe United States has insisted it will keep up the pressure against Iran on other issues. \n\nIn an NPR interview in August, President Obama underlined this point:\"We'll still have our sanctions in place with respect to non-nuclear activities like sponsorship of terrorism or violation of human rights.\" \n\nThat matches what Secretary of State John Kerry told NPR shortly after negotiating the deal. He said the U.S. was, \"absolutely\" free to punish Iran for acts like supporting the militant group Hezbollah. \n\nSo how would Iran respond if the U.S. imposes new sanctions, or reimposes old sanctions, for issues other than nuclear issues? \n\nLarijani suggested that could lead to trouble. \n\n\"There are different points mentioned in the text that need to be read carefully,\" he said. \"The text said that no country will go after new sanctions.\" \n\nIf Iran views the other side as violating the deal, \"we will respond accordingly.\" \n\nThe two sides may agree on what the nuclear deal says on paper. But arguments loom over what it really means in practice. \n\n\"I think there are some people who want to wreck the deal, so they are trying to find new ways to make holes or to perforate the deal, but we are not going to do this,\" Larijani said. But, he added, \"if anybody wrecks the deal in any way, then we will know how to respond to it.\" \n\nWill Reforms Follow?  \n\nLarijani's answer to one question was particularly revealing, both in what he said and what he did not say. \n\nThis was the question: Is there a specific economic, political, or social reform that is likely to become reality now? After all, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has indicated that he would like reforms inside Iran to follow a nuclear deal. \n\n\"I think he meant, mostly he meant, economic reforms,\" Larijani answered. \"So, I see very much eye-to-eye with him in this matter,\" Larijani said. \"I think we can make it possible for the economy to thrive.\" \n\nHe dismissed questions about political or social reforms. He said nothing of easing Iran's constraints on personal freedom, or the media, or the Internet. He argued instead that Iranian society is more free than that of its neighbors. \n\nAsked if Iran might now free political candidates who've been under house arrest since a disputed election in 2009, Larijani said only that it was up to the justice system. \n\nAsked if Iran might free several imprisoned Americans, such as the journalist Jason Rezaian , Larijani suggested that the United States should trade Iranian prisoners for them. \n\nA Way To Move Forward  \n\nLarijani cautioned that the nuclear deal alone might not transform Iran's relations with the West. \"Iran and the U.S. have this past history that is very dark,\" he said. \n\nLarijani recited the Iranian view of that history. He didn't mention moments on Americans' minds, like the 1979 hostage crisis, or Iran's calls to eliminate Israel, or Iran's past secret nuclear activities. He talked instead of 1953, when the U.S. supported a coup in Iran. In the 1980's the U.S. supported Iran's mortal enemy, Saddam Hussein of Iraq. \n\nWorking through this history, the soft-spoken Iranian gradually became more heated. \n\n\"I'm not saying that we should live in the past, but we should not try to find dramatic solutions,\" he said, \"and if we see that there is a change in the U.S. attitude toward us, then we can do something with each other.\" \n\nAs translated by his official interpreter, Larijani went on to say: \n\n\"You know, these days we are supposed to paving the ground for the ratification and the implementation of the deal. We have to prepare the public opinion for this, but everyday it seems that your secretary of defense [Ash Carter] wakes up in the morning, opens the window, he shouts something at Iran and says that the military option is still on the table. \n\nSo what does this mean? If you really want to do \u2014 to have war, then just go with it. Why are you just talking about it all the time? Why is it that you just talk about it? I mean, does \u2014 does it solve anything? Is it of any use?\" \n\nA Farsi speaker employed by NPR heard Larijani's wording slightly differently\u2014he did not literally say \"go with it\"\u2014but added that the interpreter properly captured Larijani's meaning and tone. \n\nA provocative question had led to Larijani's outburst: would he like to invite U.S. lawmakers, many of whom disapprove of the nuclear deal, to visit Iran? \n\nLarijani concluded his long answer by saying, in effect, that this is not possible yet. \n\nHe described the nuclear agreement as a test for the United States \u2014 just as the United States has posed the agreement as a test for Iran.","title":"Iran Parliament Chief: Nuclear Deal Is 'Acceptable,' U.S. Interpretation Is Not","media-type":"News","source":"WAMC.org","published":"2015-09-08T10:07:31Z"}

Past News Releases RSS    \n\r Chicago, IL (PRWEB) \r September 15, 2015 \r \n\nLenders like The Federal Savings Bank are always keeping tabs on rental markets across the USA.  Strong rental markets usually also contain strong real estate markets. \n \nThe Federal Savings Bank was intrigued by data released in a CNN Money article from August 19th titled \u201c America's most expensive rental markets \u201d. \n \nPerhaps surprisingly, 10 out of the 15 markets presented resided in California.  Due to the abundance of tech companies and high salaries, Cali is the most abundantly expensive state to live in terms of rents. \n \nThe average percentage of income spent on rent in all 10 California cities was above 40% for: Salinas, San Luis Obispo, San Diego, Santa Rosa, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Napa, Santa Cruz, San Francisco, and San Jose.  Above 40% is a very high level.  For Los Angeles, where the median income is $61,482, the average percentage of income spent on rent is 48.9%. Just think of how much money could be saved by owning instead of renting! \n \nWashington D.C. while expensive at a $2,104 per month level of rent, showed the lowest percentage of income spent on rent at just 26.8% thanks to high median incomes of the area at $94,204. \n \nThe Federal Savings Bank believes high costing rental markets are places that give an incentive to first-time home buyers the most to purchase a property.  With home prices on the rise and 30-year fixed mortgage rates continuing to trend sub 4%, now is an affordable time to purchase a property. \n \nThe Federal Savings Bank encourages all prospective home buyers and mortgage applicants to do the math and see just how much less expensive owning is versus renting.  Frequently, the cost of a mortgage + property taxes + association fees are less than the monthly cost of rent! \n \nContact the Federal Savings Bank, a veteran owned bank, to learn more about mortgages. \n  \nShare article on social media or email","title":"America's Most Expensive Rental Markets","media-type":"News","source":"PRWeb","published":"2015-09-15T08:00:32Z"}

Reading some of the bile that people write can be truly depressing. \n \nThen we have our own Sunshine Coast councillors squabbling about overtime fees passed on to funeral directors by the council should families grieve too long by their loved ones' graveside. \n \n\"It's user pays. The funeral director doesn't have to pass it on,\" half of the councillors tried to defensively spout. \n \nI have to ask myself, at what point in life do you stop hearing what you are actually saying? \n \nDo they know what they sound like? \n \nThankfully, my faith was restored, first when a majority of councillors voted to waive two funeral overtime fees, and, more importantly, when a local man phoned the paper during the week after reading the story of a local Lyme disease sufferer in need of a new wheelchair. \n \n\"I'll pay for it, but I don't want anyone to know it was me,\" the man said. \n \nThat was it.

{"id":"084cd2ab-a75e-433e-8057-53e5af85bbba","content":"With his home run in the third inning Saturday, Joc Pederson climbed the franchise leaderboard for most home runs by a rookie: \n\nMike Piazza\t1993\t35 Joc Pederson\t2015\t25 Del Bissonette\t1928\t25 \n    \nPHOENIX >> Corey Seager\u2019s torrid start isn\u2019t enough to guarantee the rookie shortstop a spot in the Dodgers\u2019 starting lineup once Jimmy Rollins returns. Rollins has been unable to hit or play the field in five games this week because of a tender right index finger. \n\nMeanwhile Seager is batting .448 with an on-base percentage of.568 through his first nine major league games. He went 4 for 4 with a home run and stole a base in the Dodgers\u2019 win Saturday. He\u2019s reached base in all nine of his plate appearances the last two days. \n  \nOnce Rollins returns, however, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said the plan for Seager \u201calways has been to play him some at short and give Jimmy days, give (Justin Turner) days at third. He\u2019s played more than we thought from the standpoint of injuries and he\u2019s done a good job. \n\nWhile he\u2019s been praised for his defense and leadership, Rollins also ranks last among qualified National League shortstops in batting average (.220) and on-base percentage (.279). \n\nThe 36-year-old is available to pinch run, but hasn\u2019t been cleared to bat or play the field. Mattingly said there\u2019s no timetable for Rollins to return. \n  \nSeager, meanwhile, continues to impress. His home run was the second-hardest hit by a Dodger this season at 110 mph. \n\n\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t make me nervous,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cHe\u2019s got that (Adrian Gonzalez) heartbeat. It\u2019s slow. He\u2019ll live to be 108, I bet.\u201d \n\nMattingly has shunned any questions about potential playoff roster scenarios so far. But with the Dodgers\u2019 magic number to clinch the division nearing single digits (14), the battle for the final NLDS roster spots will soon be a main focal point of the season. \n  \nEven if he doesn\u2019t supplant Rollins as the starting shortstop this season, Seager could still make an impact as a reserve. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be really good,\u201d Mattingly said, \u201cand he is really good.\u201d \nPuig not in the house \nWhy isn\u2019t Yasiel Puig at Chase Field? \n\nGood question. \n\n\u201cI expected him to be here, honestly,\u201d Mattingly said. \n\nPuig is rehabbing a strained right hamstring at Camelback Ranch in nearby Glendale. He hasn\u2019t played since Aug. 27. While the team hasn\u2019t reported any setbacks in Puig\u2019s rehab, \u201che\u2019s not working out on the field; he\u2019s working out in water and the Alter-G.\u201d \n \n\r\r \n  \nAs baseball activities go, Puig isn\u2019t doing any less than pitcher Brandon McCarthy, for one, who\u2019s out for the season following Tommy John surgery on his right elbow. But McCarthy is with his teammates in the clubhouse and the dugout during games. \n\nPuig, who\u2019s rehabbing a half-hour away, is not. \n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s invited,\u201d Mattingly said. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is he\u2019s welcome.\u201d \n\nMattingly said that Puig will return to Los Angeles with the team when it flies home tomorrow night. \nAlso \nKik\u00e9 Hernandez (strained left hamstring) ran on the field prior to the game. \u2026 Howie Kendrick (strained left hamstring) will get 10 at-bats Monday and Tuesday at Dodger Stadium in live batting practice. He is still unable to run at full speed, though \u201chis time was pretty good, faster than the day before,\u201d according to Mattingly. \u2026 Condolences to the family of Dodger Stadium chef Dave Pearson, who died at age 75. He had been battling lung cancer.","title":"Corey Seager's days as the Dodgers' starting shortstop are numbered","media-type":"News","source":"SGV Tribune","published":"2015-09-12T07:01:00Z"}

The new information includes \n      estimated ranges for each 2016 tax bracket as well as projections for a \n      growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures, such as the personal \n      exemption and the standard deduction. Projections are based on the \n      relevant inflation data recently released by the U.S. Department of \n      Labor. \n  \n Inflation Adjustments - Background  \n \nSince the late 1980s, the U.S. Tax Code has required that federal income \n      tax brackets be adjusted for inflation annually, and inflation \n      adjustments have been inserted into the Internal Revenue Code in recent \n      years with increasing frequency. For example, the Code now requires over \n      50 other inflation-driven computations to determine deduction, exemption \n      and exclusion amounts in addition to the 40 separate computations needed \n      to inflation-adjust the tax bracket tables each year. \n \n Media Assistance  \n \nExpert analysis plus additional details regarding the following \n      projections and tax topics are available for media members interested in \n      speaking with federal tax experts at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US. \n      For interview requests, please contact Laura Gingiss ( laura.gingiss@wolterskluwer.com ), \n      847-267-2213 or Eric Scott ( eric.scott@wolterskluwer.com ), \n      847-267-2179. \n \n Key Tax Savings, Non-increase Estimates for 2016 : \n \nProjections based on the Department of Labor's inflation figures for the \n      12-month period between August 31, 2014, and August 31, 2015 suggest \n      most taxpayers will experience modest savings, compared to 2015 tax \n      filings. For example: \n Because of the income ranges bracketing the marginal tax rates have \n        increased, a single filer with taxable income of $50,000 should owe \n        $22.50 less next year due to the adjustments to the income tax rate \n        brackets between 2015 and 2016.  A married couple filing jointly with a total taxable income of \n        $100,000 should pay $45 less income taxes in 2016 than they will on \n        the same income for 2015 because of indexing of their tax bracket for \n        2016.  The dependent standard deduction, used on the returns of individuals \n        claimed as dependents on another taxpayer's tax return, remains at \n        $1,050 for 2016.  The additional standard deduction for those 65-years-old and older or \n        who are blind will remain at $1,250 for 2016, as will the $1,550 \n        additional amount for single aged 65 or older or blind filers.  \n Inflation-adjusted Tax Increase Estimates for 2016:  \n The personal exemption amount gets bumped up by inflation by $50, to \n        $4,050 for 2016, up from $4,000 in 2015.  The standard deduction for single, married filing jointly, and married \n        filing separately filers is expected to remain the same for 2016. The \n        standard deduction for heads of household is expected to rise from \n        $9,250 for 2015 to $9,300 for 2016. Any increase in the standard \n        deduction, of course, can produce lower taxes by decreasing the \n        taxpayer's taxable income.  Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projects the following for 2016 \n        alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemptions: For married joint filers and surviving spouses, the exemption will \n            be adjusted upward to $83,800, up from $83,400 for 2015.  For unmarried single filers and heads of households, the 2016 \n            exemption will be $53,900, up from $53,600 for 2015.  For married single filers, the exemption will increase to $41,900, \n            up from $41,700 in 2015.   The 2016 year represents the third year that the 39.6-percent tax \n        bracket for higher-income taxpayers, enacted by the American Taxpayer \n        Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), will be imposed. For 2016, Wolters Kluwer \n        projects that the minimum income amounts at which this top tax rate \n        will kick in will rise to: $466,950 (from $464,850) for married joint filers  $441,000 (from $439,000) for heads of households  $415,050 (from $413,200) for unmarried filers  $233,475 (from $232,425) for married separate filers  These inflation-adjusted amounts also trigger a 20-percent tax on \n            that portion of taxable income attributable to net capital gains \n            and qualified dividends that exceed these bracket amounts.   The estate and gift tax applicable exemption was first set at a $5 \n        million level back in 2011. The amount has been adjusted for inflation \n        by Congress and is now projected at $5,450,000 for 2016. A spousal \n        portability election can now effectively protect double that amount \n        against estate and gift tax ($10,900,000 for 2016).  The 2016 foreign earned income exclusion will increase to $101,300 for \n        2016, up from $100,800 for 2015.  The income phaseout range for married joint filers making Roth IRA \n        contributions will be $184,000 to $194,000 for 2016, an increase from \n        $183,000 and $193,000 for 2015.  \n Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US 2016 Tax \n      Projections *  \n \nAs cited earlier, Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projections for \n      indexed amounts are based on the relevant inflation data released by the \n      U.S. Department of Labor.

{"id":"adbc107f-4d15-4433-8c56-fd22cc0b1c36","content":"Taking calcium supplements or eating more dairy to improve bone health has little or no effect, according to new research. \n\nThere is scant evidence that taking calcium supplements prevents fractures and no evidence that increasing calcium through the diet prevents fractures or breaks either, experts said. \n\nThe research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), collected data from dozens of studies on the issue. \n\nAccording to the NHS, adults need 700mg of calcium a day. It is recommended that people get all the calcium they need from their daily diet. \n\nThe NHS Choices website warns that taking  high doses of calcium (over 1,500mg a day) could lead to stomach pain and diarrhoea. \n\nIt says taking supplements containing less than this amount are unlikely to cause any harm. \n\nIn the latest study, experts from New Zealand concluded that efforts to increase calcium intake to improve bone health had no overall effect. \n\n\"Our analyses indicate that dietary calcium intake  is not associated with risk of fracture, and there is no evidence  currently that increasing dietary calcium intake prevents  fractures,\" they said. \n\nThey said calcium supplements have \" an unfavourable  risk:benefit profile\", meaning they could do more harm than good. \n\n\"Collectively, these results suggest that clinicians, advocacy  organisations, and health policymakers should not recommend  increasing calcium intake for fracture prevention, either with  calcium supplements or through dietary sources.\" \n\nThe experts studied a range of trials on the issue, including people aged 50 and over getting their calcium from milk or dairy, or taking calcium supplements with or without vitamin D. \n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Professor Karl Michaelsson from Uppsala University in Sweden, said  most over-50s will not benefit from increasing their intake of calcium, particularly through supplements, as some recommendations suggest. \n\n\"The weight of evidence against such mass medication of older people is now compelling, and it is surely time to reconsider these controversial recommendations,\" he said. \n\nProfessor Juliet Compston, a National Osteoporosis Society trustee, said:  \"There is not much in these studies that is new. We already know that calcium supplements increase bone density, but on their own do not reduce fractures. \n\n\"However, a recent analysis concluded that calcium and vitamin D did reduce hip and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women and older men.\"","title":"Calcium supplements 'have little effect on bone health'","media-type":"News","source":"Jersey Evening Post","published":"2015-09-29T22:30:49Z"}

The Griffith Street man then fled to the entrance of the business and called police, Morrill said. \n \nThe man provided a description of his attackers to a police dispatcher, as well as the white Infiniti they fled the scene in. Plainclothes officers in the Street Crimes Unit who were working in the area, as well as West District patrol, responded to the Romaine Avenue address to which the vehicle was registered, Morrill. \n \nPolice saw the vehicle parked at the home and eventually spotted Rojas and a third individual, Hector Poll-Ortiz, walking on Broadway.

Inmates can be segregated if they are deemed to be in danger, to prevent danger to other prisoners or as punishment for disruptive behaviour. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r \nThe IMB cited a United Nations protocol which defines solitary confinement for more than 22 hours a day as torture and said m any inmates in segregation at the Cambridgeshire jail were often confined for longer. \n\nThe report, covering the year to May 2015, said: \"Although often faced with challenging prisoners, requiring officers to get into and  out of personal protection equipment, on most days staff were able to offer a full  regime. \n\n\"It was not however unusual for some curtailment to be necessary,  meaning that residents might miss showers, corporate worship, phone calls and  exercise. At its worst, for example on 10 occasions in April, the Seg (segregation unit) had to be  locked down.\" \n\nThe regime in place was \"much the same\" as that which HM Inspectorate of Prisons found in 2011 to be \"inadequate\", inspectors added. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \n\"One of the other problems noted by Inspectors was the poor management  arrangements for the Seg. Whilst there have been definite improvements, with  greater adherence to procedures and standards, and consistency of decision-making,  new prison-wide staffing arrangements meant that the custody manager  responsible for the Seg was more frequently away from the unit, for example  acting as orderly officer, managing detail or on nights,\" the report said. \n\n\" We do not blame  Whitemoor managers for this merry go-round, which results from centrally-imposed  staffing norms.\" \n\nA high-profile terrorist prisoner recently won a legal challenge at the UK's highest court against his segregation at HMP Whitemoor. \n\nKamel Bourgass, an Algerian who is serving 17 years for conspiracy to commit public nuisance by using poisons or explosives in relation to the 2002 Ricin terrorist plot, was segregated for extended periods. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nThe Supreme Court ruled in July his confinement, for periods or more than a month, was unlawful beyond the initial 72-hour period. \n\n\r\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.","title":"Whitemoor prisoner 'kept in solitary for more than two years'","media-type":"News","source":"Ripley and Heanor News","published":"2015-09-26T05:23:03Z"}

His sister, Christina Carrari, had called the Sheriff's Department to report that he had threatened her. \n\nFour deputies responding to the report went to Ronald Carrari's house south of Los Alamos, where he refused to come out of the house because the deputies did not have a warrant. Two of the responding deputies testified Friday that Ronald Carrari had said he was going to get his guns. \n\n\"I heard him say, 'You got your guns, I'm getting mine,'\" Deputy Jonathan Fleming said. \n\nHowever, Fleming and Deputy Bobby Fortier also testified that they had actually seen him holding a gun. A search of his home yielded eight guns, including one that is apparently illegal under California law, a Taurus handgun that fires .410 shotgun shells, making it a short-barreled shotgun. \n\nAt some point during the incident, Ronald Carrari, audibly upset, called 911, expressing fear that deputies were going to kill him and saying that the Sheriff's Department had a \"vendetta\" against him. \n\nAfter being arrested under suspicion of making criminal threats and resisting arrest, Ronald Carrari bailed out of jail. He was rearrested after being accused of threatening his sister again several days later. \n\nThe two incidents apparently stemmed from Christina Carrari limiting the hours that her brother could visit their ailing mother, although Ronald Carrari had a history of not getting along with other members of the family, and his father and his developmentally disabled brother had recently obtained restraining orders against him. \n\nChristina Carrari testified that her brother was allowed to visit their mother between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., which she said were \"her best hours.\" \n\nOther family members were not subject to the visitation hours. Christina Carrari testified that this was due to Ronald Carrari's prior behavior. \n\n\"He was upsetting mom as well as wreaking havoc with all of us,\" she said. \n\nTheir mother died March 18. \n\nThe second incident in which Ronald Carrari is accused of threatening his sister occurred at a memorial service for their mother. Ronald Carrari allegedly placed a memorial planter box with threatening messages written on it outside of the Union Hotel, where the service was being held.\u00a0 \n\nTestimony will continue Wednesday morning.","title":"Deputies testify in trial of Los Alamos standoff suspect","media-type":"News","source":"Santa Ynez Valley News","published":"2015-09-05T01:00:00Z"}
{"id":"eb497d2c-aa44-48bc-a1b5-e691b773b469","content":"The Asus MG279Q is one of two models in this roundup - the other is the Acer XB270HU - to use in-plane switching (IPS) technology. The other monitors use twisted nematic (TN) panels, which have inferior viewing angles.\n\nHence, if viewing angles are your biggest concern, you should be looking at these two models.\n\nThe Acer and the Asus differ mainly in the variable refresh rate technology used. Asus supports AMD FreeSync, while Acer uses Nvidia's G-Sync technology. The variable refresh rate range on the Asus is between 35Hz and 90Hz. This is not as wide as the Acer (30Hz to 144Hz) and the BenQ XL2730Z (40Hz to 144Hz). However, it is probably adequate as most games should be running at frame rates within this range. If your games fall outside this range, you can probably tweak their graphics settings to bring them back within the range to benefit from FreeSync.\n\nPhysically, the monitor is fairly slim, with a 13mm-wide bezel.\n\nOverall, my impression is that the monitor is not overly loud and should appeal to non-gamers too.\n\nYou can pivot the Asus 90 degrees for a portrait orientation or swivel it by up to 60 degrees to its sides. It has a pair of built-in speakers and two USB 3.0 ports at the bottom rear of the display.\n\nNavigate the on-screen display (OSD) settings with a joystick. The monitor includes six predefined settings, or profiles, that are optimised for different usage modes, from watching movies to playing a first-person shooter game.\n\nA demo feature helps you decide whether the selected profile is suitable. It splits the screen into two, with one half showing the original display setting and the other the chosen profile, so that you can see both side by side. A crosshair overlay can be turned on to help gamers aim in shooting games.\n\nScreen brightness topped out at 270 nits, making it one of the brightest models I have tested. However, colour accuracy was average with a score of 3 out of 5 compared to 4.5 for the Acer. Several handy features for gamers\n\nGamers will like this BenQ XL2730Z monitor. Not only does it support AMD FreeSync for a smooth gaming experience (with a compatible AMD graphics card), but also it has a number of features that cater to gamers.\n\nFor example, you can hang your headset on a retractable hook at the left of the display. A carry handle makes it easier to take the monitor to LAN gaming parties.\n\nYou can plug your headset into the monitor, as it has headphone and microphone jacks. On-screen display (OSD) settings let gamers adjust the headset volume or mute the headset microphone.\n\nThe BenQ's screen can pivot 90 degrees to a portrait orientation. It lets you swivel 45 degrees to the sides - more limited than other monitors I've tried. The monitor comes with a unique feature that I find useful. The OSD settings can be adjusted using an external controller dubbed the S Switch. The wired round puck, which comes with large buttons and a scroll wheel, fits neatly into a circular indent at the base of the monitor stand.\n\nI find the S Switch easier to use than traditional OSD buttons on other monitors. You can also save up to three different sets of display settings, and switch quickly between them using the S Switch.\n\nGaming-centric features include a Black Equalizer mode, which attempts to brighten dark areas of the screen so that you can spot concealed enemies more easily during a game. There is also a motion-blur reduction feature that helps reduce the amount of smearing during fast action games.\n\nBut both features have their downsides. The Black Equalizer mode makes everything look overexposed and affects colour accuracy. Turning on blur reduction leads to a reduction in screen brightness. So use them with discretion.\n\nThe AMD FreeSync feature on this BenQ monitor works for refresh rates from 40Hz to 144Hz - the widest range among the three AMD FreeSync monitors in this round-up. Its closest rival is the Asus MG279Q, which has a FreeSync range of 35Hz to 90Hz.\n\nThe viewing angle is decent, but not as wide as on monitors that use in-plane switching display technology. Nevertheless, the BenQ's twisted nematic screen has good colour accuracy - as long as you do not use its Black Equalizer mode. Lower screen resolution is a letdown\n\nThe biggest flaw in this Philips monitor is its 1,920 x 1,080-pixel screen resolution. While this resolution is adequate for a 24-inch monitor, it is not good enough for a 27-inch display. In comparison, the other monitors in this roundup have screen resolutions of at least 2,560 x 1,440 pixels.\n\nTo be fair, the lower screen resolution may be useful for gamers with less powerful computers. They can run games smoothly at the native resolution without having to reduce their graphics settings. On the other hand, the Philips monitor does not look as sharp as its rivals when it comes to browsing the Internet or reading a document.\n\nViewing from the sides and the bottom is poor, though not unexpected, given that this monitor uses a twisted nematic (TN) panel instead of in-plane switching (IPS) technology. There is one upside though: TN screens usually have low response time and input lag. As a result, games, especially first-person shooters, feel responsive.\n\nPhilips has tried to inject a bit of flair into the design. The display has a red strip in front and its stand has an opening for cables to pass through. You can rotate the screen by 90 degrees to portrait orientation, and swivel the display to the right or left by 65 degrees.\n\nHowever, the bezel looks chunky at around 25mm at the top and 20mm at the sides. A laptop-style external power brick is required. Like most Nvidia G-Sync monitors, the Philips monitor has a single DisplayPort connector. There are no HDMI or DVI inputs. But there is an integrated USB hub with four USB 3.0 ports at the back.\n\nTouch-sensitive buttons operate the on-screen display settings. The settings are fairly basic with no profiles for specific tasks.\n\nThere is an option to display a crosshair on the screen to help players in first-person shooter games. But this lone gamer feature feels like a token gesture.\n\nIn my test with a colourimeter, the Philips covered 99 per cent of the sRGB colour space. Colour accuracy was decent, but not as good as some of its competitors.\n\nAt $999, the Philips is one of the least expensive Nvidia G-Sync monitors in the market, though AMD FreeSync models are around the same price.\n\nHowever, the IPS-based Acer XB270HU arguably provides better value despite being more expensive at $1,099. Friendly price tag but there's a catch\n\nOf the five monitors in this round-up, Samsung U28E590DS is the only model with an ultra high-definition (also known as 4K) resolution. Its rivals have a screen resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels or fewer.\n\nYet, it is one of the more affordable monitors at $899. Only the BenQ XL2730Z is cheaper ($888).\n\nBut there is a catch. The Samsung monitor uses a twisted nematic (TN) panel with viewing angles that are not as wide as other displays based on in-plane switching (IPS) technology. The bottom viewing angle is especially bad, with significant colour shift.\n\nSamsung has tried to remedy this inherent weakness in TN displays with an image enhancement feature dubbed Samsung Magic Angle. This feature offers five different profiles, each designed to alleviate the poor viewing angles of the display for specific scenarios. For instance, Group View is intended for multiple viewers while Lean Back tries to improve the viewing experience when looking at the display from below.\n\nIn practice, Magic Angle works pretty well - so much so that I could almost forget that this is a monitor with a TN display.\n\nThe Samsung scored well in our colour accuracy test. I also like that it comes with a joystick for users to adjust the on-screen display settings. It is easier to use than the usual buttons.\n\nHowever, you will need a high-end gaming system to get the most out of this monitor. Unlike its rivals, the Samsung has a very limited FreeSync range (40 to 60Hz). This means that unless your game is running between 40 and 60 frames per second, it will not benefit from FreeSync. To achieve such consistent frame rates in the latest games at 3,840 x 2,160 pixels requires a powerful computer, such as one with dual graphics cards.\n\nIt is not a deal-breaker if you have a high-end system, but keep this in mind if you are buying the monitor solely for the FreeSync feature. Other flaws that may put you off: The monitor lacks pivot and swivel functionality and it also has no USB ports.","title":"IPS gaming monitor has great viewing angles","media-type":"News","source":"Straits Times","published":"2015-09-15T21:00:00Z"}

Registration for the Team America Rocketry Challenge (TARC) is now open for teams of 7-12th grade students through December 4. \n\nTARC is the U.S. aerospace and defense industry\u2019s flagship program designed to encourage students to pursue study and careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Structured to emulate the aerospace industry's design, fabrication and testing process, TARC requires teams to build and fly a model rocket that meets challenging design requirements and precise targets for altitude and flight duration. \n\nEach year, TARC's rules and scoring parameters change to challenge the students' ingenuity and encourage a fresh approach to rocket design. This year's rules require teams to build and launch a rocket carrying two raw eggs to 850 feet and return them to Earth unbroken within a flight duration of 44 to 46 seconds.

These contractors often knock on homeowners' doors and say they need a new roof or siding due to wind and hail damage \u2013 all cosmetic damage repairs that may not be necessary. Fixing it may help a home look better, but it won't function better. \n \nHome insurance companies often classify dents, dimples and dings in roof vents, shingles or aluminum siding as \"cosmetic damage\" to a property, says Billy Van Jura, an insurance broker in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. \n \n\"When several claims for this type of work are submitted in a single region, the price everyone pays (including those who haven't filed a claim) can increase because the insurer sees the region as having greater risk of additional claims,\" an article at realtor.com\u00ae cautions. \"There's nothing you can do about a widespread storm that damages several homes in your area and ultimately raises everyone's rates.\" \n \nHowever, \"you can help curb your own annual home insurance costs with a little-known option called 'cosmetic damage exclusion.\" \n \nThe American Association of Insurance Services created the cosmetic damage exclusion in 2013. Its goal is to protect consumers from scammers and attempt to keep home insurance rates more affordable by making cosmetic damage coverage optional. \n \nHomeowners can then decide if they want to pay for cosmetic-only wind and hail damage. If the damage impacts the safety or structural functionality of the home, the home insurance policy kicks in. \n \nBy adding this exclusion to cosmetic damage, homeowners stand to save money on their annual premiums \u2013 anywhere from $100 to $200 or more, says Troy Thompson, an independent insurance broker with Pinnacle Insurance Agency in Coon Rapids, Minn. \n \nHail and wind damage claims alone contribute to about 40 percent of all home insurance claims in the last five years, according to the Insurance Information Institute. And many of those claims may be for minor cosmetic repairs, such as a few nicks in the siding that homeowners may be told are more urgent than they actually are. \n \nHomeowners who remain covered for cosmetic damage may submit a claim, but they may also have to pay applicable deductibles, insurance agents say. \n \nSource: \"The Money-Saving Home Insurance Option No One Will Ever Tell You About,\" realtor.com\u00ae (Sept. 23, 2015) \n \n\u00a9 Copyright 2015 INFORMATION, INC.

We have a big heart. However, there is a\nlimit to what we can do,\" President Joachim Gauck, a former\nrights activist in communist East Germany, said in a speech on\nSunday evening. \n \n\"Our ability to take in people is limited, although we don't\nknow yet where those limits are,\" he added. \n \nThe comments from the head of state, who has a largely\nceremonial role but whose words carry moral authority, appeared\nto be striking a more cautious tone than Chancellor Angela\nMerkel who has said Germany can cope with the record influx. \n \nThe government declined to respond directly to Gauck's\ncomments, reflecting political convention, but defended its\nhandling of the situation. \n \n\"The German government and the chancellor are convinced that\nprotection has to be given to those who need it, whether they\nare persecuted for political reasons or fleeing war,\" said\ngovernment spokesman Steffen Seibert. \n \nThe debate came amid signs of growing tension among asylum\nseekers, part of a wave of mass migration into the European\nUnion from the Middle East and parts of Africa. \n \nFourteen people were injured on Sunday when a brawl broke\nout between two rival groups in a refugee center in the western\nGerman town of Calden, police said. The refugees were being\nhoused in tents set up on a disused airfield. \n \nA union representing German police officers has suggested\nthat refugees should be divided according to their religion to\ntry to reduce the risk of conflict. \n \nGermany has reintroduced border controls with EU neighbors\nto try to regulate the flow of people after initially throwing\nopen its doors to refugees from Syria. \n \nThe central government also agreed last week to give its 16\nregional states around 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) next year\nto help cover the cost of looking after refugees. \n \n\"The German government stands by its decision to now\nintroduce signs of order into the process for the arrival and\nthe admission of refugees,\" Seibert added. \n \nMerkel's popularity has dropped sharply over her handling of\nthe refugee crisis, two polls showed at the weekend, indicating\na shift in the mood in the Europe Union's most populous country.\n  \n\n (Additional reporting by Tina Bellon; Editing by Noah Barkin\nand Alison Williams)","title":"UPDATE 1-German president warns of limits to number of refugees","media-type":"News","source":"Philly.com","published":"2015-09-28T12:30:01Z"}

He initially planned to ask to serve his jail term in Hong Kong. \u2018He was desperate not to serve a jail term in the UK because he said he would be singled out and beaten up as a sex offender there,\u2019 O\u2019Neill said. \n\nHowever, when a lawyer in Hong Kong told him he must serve his term in the UK, Tsang considered fleeing to the nearby Chinese gambling resort of Macau, which has no UK extradition treaty, or slipping into Thailand on a false passport. \n\nHe eventually decided to stay in hiding in Hong Kong and around ten days ago moved into an unfurnished 28th floor flat in the city\u2019s Ap Lei Chau district. \n   \nSkater: Tsang is circled above in Dancing On Ice, which he appeared on in 2009 alongside Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean \n\nO\u2019Neill \u2013 who makes a living selling electronic goods on eBay \u2013 said: \u2018Joey was a nice guy but when I saw him this time, he wasn\u2019t the guy I used to know. He seemed to have gone a bit crazy. When he spoke about the UK cases, he said he did have sex with the girls but insisted it wasn\u2019t rape.\u2019 \n\nStephanie said: \u2018When we went to see him, he was always asking me for girls and looking at the girls on my Facebook page and saying, \u201cSet me up with her\u201d. He was creepy.\u2019 \n\nO\u2019Neill stayed in daily contact with police in the UK and Hong Kong as he continued visiting Tsang while an extradition order was drawn up. \n\nTsang, meanwhile, grew increasingly paranoid, using binoculars to watch for police cars and monitoring the internet for news of the manhunt for him. Yesterday, Tsang appeared in a Hong Kong court where he was remanded in custody. A lawyer representing him said he would contest extradition. \n\nTory MP Nicola Blackwood, for Oxford West and Abingdon, said last night: \u2018Tsang inflicted a living nightmare on his victims but ran like a coward when he faced justice. I want to thank The Mail on Sunday for their help. It is going to make a big difference to the victims.\u2019 \n\nA Home Office spokesman said Tsang\u2019s sister\u2019s passport was clean and therefore did not arouse suspicion at Heathrow because he was not on a flight risk database. \n\nShe added: \u2018Ultimately it is an airline\u2019s responsibility to check a passport matches the person travelling.\u2019 \n\nA spokesman for Heathrow Airport said: \u2018We do not comment on security matters.\u2019","title":"Dancing On Ice skater rapist Joseph Tsang captured in Hong Kong honey trap","media-type":"News","source":"Mail Online UK","published":"2015-09-26T23:44:12Z"}

{"id":"a4be3e34-9807-4837-bdfb-df9ddb6a1865","content":"A BIG criticism of Mark Cooper\u2019s play-off final-losing side last season was they only had one way to win a game. \n \nThe manager often explained this was because of the players he had and using a system that best suited their abilities. \n \nTo some extent this season, he has either demonstrated a willingness to work with multiple systems or he feels he has more tactically astute players. Given the relative experience of the players he has now and the ones departed, you would surmise it is probably the latter. \n \nCooper admitted on Saturday that a difference in formation is often as little as a five-yard tweak, but in the context of the win at Crewe, it was important. \n \nIn the first half, Town started with a 4-2-3-1. James Brophy, making his second senior start, was pushed forward into the advanced left-wing position and Nicky Ajose was given the task on the right. \n \nIt was not very successful. Brophy struggled to get forward as he too often had to help out Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill, who was having a poor game against Ryan Colclough. Eventually, Brophy was moved into defence. \n \nWith just two central midfielders to link play between attack and defence, Swindon actually struggled to dominate the ball. \n \nAt half-time, the Town boss accepted he would not be able to control the midfield with the players he had available and instead opted to utilise his forwards' ability on the break. \n \nOrmonde-Ottewill\u2019s injury was a blessing in disguise. Brophy dealt much better with Colclough and Cooper used the opportunity to switch to a 4-4-2 diamond, with youngster Tom Smith coming on to provide more energy in midfield. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nThough Town ceded control of midfield and spent more time defending, they looked a more potent attacking force with Nicky Ajose and Wes Thomas paired together up front. \n \nChances came when they stretched Crewe\u2019s defence with balls in behind, but it was also the ability of the two strikers to harry their opponents and win the ball high up the pitch that created chances.","title":"TALKING TACTICS: finding the right Plan B","media-type":"News","source":"Wiltshire Gazette and Herald","published":"2015-09-07T04:30:00Z"}

This month, I'm going to focus on consistent days, not numbers on the scale. No more Tuesday stress. \n\n2) Enjoy the transition to fall by getting outside to exercise! I love fall. The sights, the smells, the activities, the return to comfy sweaters and other comfy clothes. I'm going to take in every moment and try to incorporate at least one outdoor workout into my weekly routine. Last night, my daughter and I walked three miles. It was her first day back to school and I spent the entire 45 minutes talking with her about her day, her friends, her life. It was priceless and I am definitely going to do it again soon! \n\n3) Finding joy in NSVs! I'm a big scale watcher. I weigh myself twice a day and I've always used that number as my \"go to\" measure of success. This month, I'm going to focus on other things. Did I track all week (and I mean EVERY bite)? Do these pants fit better? Can I walk further\/stay on the elliptical longer without feeling so tired? The scale will drop if I keep working hard. It won't be on my timeline maybe, but that's okay as long as I'm seeing progress. \n\nSo, here's to September and making it a great time to shape up and slim down!","title":"September Shape Up!","media-type":"News","source":"Weight Watchers","published":"2015-09-01T18:03:58Z"}

When  Elementary  returns this fall, Sherlock ( Jonny Lee Miller ) will be dealing with the aftermath of his relapse in last season's finale. One of the consequences? His father Morland Holmes, played by John Noble , is coming to New York to check up on his son. Morland is an international consultant who has a lot of power and has amassed a considerable fortune. \"He's someone who works from the shadows to help various governments and mega-corps and titans of industry make moves around the globe,\" creator Rob Doherty tells TVGuide.com. \"He has the ear of many important and wealthy and influential people. He has a personality that's very appropriate to that kind of work and those kinds of worlds: He's very stern, very calculating, extremely bright -- but that's probably not a big surprise.

Whether or not the elder Holmes will try to apply those skills to his son remains to be seen, but Morland will stick his nose into Sherlock's first case back, which is loosely inspired by the canonical story, \"The Adventure of Wysteria Lodge.\" Guest star Patrick Page, whom we met in last season's finale, will reprise the role of Jonathan Bloom, a man with an unsavory history of preying on desperate women who then disappear. This time, however, Bloom will seek out Sherlock for help. \"Bloom insists that he is not responsible for the disappearance of at least one of the women,\" Doherty says. \"His wife vanished without a trace five years ago. He's always insisted that he's innocent. He's been in the tabloids quite a bit. So, he approaches Sherlock, engages him and wants Sherlock Holmes to prove that he's innocent of his wife's disappearance.\" Elementary returns for its fourth season on Thursday, Nov. 4 at 10\/9c on CBS.

Job | For the Associated Press  Updated 12:52PM   \nDon\u2019t let the Pilot\u2019s new, sleek look fool you. Honda\u2019s largest sport utility vehicle is bigger than ever on the inside, particularly in its third-row seats. \n \nRevamped from roof to tires, the 2016 Pilot shed its boxy exterior and upgraded its interior while adding features and power and is now capable of generating 280 horsepower from its re-engineered and noticeably refined V-6 engine. \n \nIt also shed weight, putting this more powerful Pilot at the top in fuel mileage among large three-row gasoline-powered 2016 SUVs. The front-wheel drive 2016 Pilot with a new nine-speed automatic transmission is rated by the federal government at 20 mpg in city driving and 27 mpg on the highway. \n \nThere\u2019s even a new top-of-the-line Pilot Elite that comes standard with 20-inch wheels, leather seats and spacious second-row captain\u2019s chairs, as well as the latest safety equipment and luxury-car features like a heated steering wheel. \n \nThe starting manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price, including destination charge, for the 2016 Pilot is $30,875 for a base LX model with front-wheel drive. The lowest starting retail price, including destination charge, for an all-wheel drive Pilot LX is $32,675. \n \nThe new Elite model, which has standard all-wheel drive, is priced at $47,300. \n \nThe Pilot\u2019s 3.5-liter V-6 engine adds direct injection to help boost horsepower by 30 over last year\u2019s model. Torque is increased by 9, to 262 foot-pounds at 4,700 rpm, and the test-driven model zoomed forward and merged into traffic with surprising ease. \n 2016 Honda Pilot AWD Elite  \nBASE PRICE: $29,995 for FWD LX; $31,795 for AWD LX; $32,430 for FWD EX; $34,230 for AWD EX; $35,905 for FWD EX-L; $37,705 for AWD EX-L; $41,020 for FWD Touring; $42,820 for AWD Touring; $46,420 for AWD Elite. \n \nPRICE AS TESTED: $42,225. \n \nTYPE: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, seven-passenger, large sport utility vehicle. \n \nENGINE: 3.5-liter, single overhead cam, direct injection V-6 with i-VTEC and variable cylinder management. \n \nMILEAGE: 19 mpg (city), 26 mpg (highway). \n \nTOP SPEED: NA. \n \nLENGTH: 194.5 inches. \n \nWHEELBASE: 111 inches. \n \nCURB WEIGHT: 4,317 pounds. \n \nBUILT AT: Lincoln, Ala. \n \nOPTIONS: None. \n \nDESTINATION CHARGE: $880. \n \nThe Associated Press \n\nWith the nine-speed transmission, which is only available on the Touring and Elite models and was in the test-driven Pilot Elite, the engine is surprisingly quiet and vibration-free. Lower trim levels get the carryover six-speed automatic, which reduces fuel mileage numbers by 1 mpg. \n \nIt\u2019s easy for a driver to forget just how large the new Pilot is because at more than 16 feet long, it feels remarkably light. The lighter weight - now starting at just over 4,000 pounds - and stiffer structure make the 2016 Pilot feel solid and stable but not ponderous. \n \nThe test-driven model was quiet inside and its supple leather seats and steering wheel wrap, soft-touch interior plastics, side-door sunscreens and 8-inch touchscreen display added to its luxurious feel. The big screen crisply displayed the view from the Pilot\u2019s backup camera. \n \nThe Elite also comes standard with a panoramic roof and four USB ports, and passengers marveled that so many luxury features could come with a Honda SUV. \n \nThe ride was comfortable, with the large SUV maintaining a smooth ride as it drove over bumps in the road. And its large, 20-inch wheels didn\u2019t transmit any heaviness to those inside. \n \nA new one-touch feature helps passengers get into the third-row seat. Just push a button and a second-row seat automatically tilts and slides to its forward-most position. The second-row seat then can return to its midpoint setting. \n \nThe Pilot\u2019s third row is easier to access because the step-in is 1.2 inches lower and 2.5 inches wider than before. The third row also has a new, three-position recline feature, and the 38.9 inches of headroom back there is more than what\u2019s in the back seat of a Toyota Camry. The Pilot\u2019s 31.9 inches of third-row legroom can accommodate adults and surpasses what\u2019s in the Kia Sorento and Toyota Highlander third rows. \n \nThe 2016 Pilot can tow up to 5,000 pounds. Every model comes with six airbags, antilock brakes, brake-assist and electronic stability control. Top trim levels of Touring and Elite add the latest forward collision and lane departure warning and collision mitigation system, among other things. \n \nIn July, 1,358 new Pilots were recalled because third-row seatbelts might be trapped between the seat and sideliner, making them difficult to use.","title":"New Honda Pilot looks smaller, adds interior space","media-type":"News","source":"The Nashville Ledger","published":"2015-09-10T17:52:06Z"}

This is the first street where we got that response. We haven\u2019t had this kind of situation before where people are getting on with themselves. I don\u2019t know what their problem is but we are here to bring service to the people.\u201d Police continued patrols in the area up to press time but there were no incidents of violence.","title":"Garbage thrown at Ahmed\u2019s tour","media-type":"News","source":"Trinidad Guardian","published":"2015-09-02T06:57:53Z"}

And the BoJ may like it because the yen may decline without their intervention (such as further stimulus),\u201d he added. \n \nAsia-Pacific currencies, including the Singapore dollar and the Malaysian ringgit, which have been battered by concerns over China and the strengthening of the dollar in recent months, also rose on Wednesday. \n \nHigher rates would tend to strengthen the greenback, and could severely hurt emerging markets as investors draw their cash out and turn to the US looking for better, safer returns. \n \nThe South Korea won rallied a day after the Standard & Poor\u2019s ratings agency raised the country\u2019s credit rating.

{"id":"68094eba-8061-4bd0-b4a7-7546b452f613","content":"In April 1987, when China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping met the Basic Law Drafting Committee members in Beijing, he criticised the suggestion to introduce the principle of separation of powers to the would-be Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. He said Hong Kong could not copy directly from the West. \n \nThe then undemocratic system in Hong Kong was based on the British system, and had been in practice for a century and a half. Deng said it would not be appropriate to introduce to such a system the separation of powers or a British or American parliamentary system, just so it could be seen as a democracy. \n \nAfter Deng's comments, the drafting committee ceased using the term \"separation of powers\". \n \nIt thus came as no surprise that in Zhang Xiaoming's recent speech on \" A Correct Understanding of the Characteristics of the Political System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \", the director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong ruled out the existence of separation of powers in Hong Kong and said that separation of powers can be built only on the basis of a political entity in possession of complete state sovereign power. \n \nWhile Zhang may be correct from a strictly legal point of view, in reality, the political system in Hong Kong has evolved since the colonial era to put in place by convention - in practice and in spirit - the principle of separation of powers. The three branches of government each have their own role and function, creating checks and balances between the executive and the legislature, while upholding judicial independence. Whatever term one may use to describe it, it is separation of powers in a real sense. \n \nZhang described the chief executive as having a \"dual head\" status, that is, he is head of the Hong Kong government and at the same time head of the SAR. Zhang also said that the chief executive has \"dual accountability\", that is, he or she is accountable to the central government and also to the Hong Kong government. \n \nBoth these \"dual\" characteristics, according to Zhang, mean that the chief executive has a special legal status that transcends the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. \n \n\n READ MORE:\u00a0Leung Chun-ying questions Hong Kong's 'separation of powers' model after controversial remarks by Beijing official  \nIn an article published in October 2013, Hao Tiechuan, director of publicity, cultural and public affairs of the central government's liaison office here, recounted that in July 1987, while drafting of the Basic Law was in progress, the British sent to the Chinese a summary on the transition issues relating to the executive and the legislature. Hao said the British team agreed that the Hong Kong government should be led by a strong executive, but there should be appropriate checks and balances between the executive and the legislature, and the two sides should maintain a cooperative relationship. \n \nHao also said that the British stated that the power to accept or reject laws passed by the Legislative Council and the power to dissolve Legco is important to the status of the chief executive under the constitution. \n \nDuring the colonial era, the governor, as the representative of the British monarch, held the power to approve or reject laws passed by legislature and the power to dissolve it, and thus had a status that truly transcended the executive and the legislature. By comparison, the chief executive has a much less \"transcendent\" status than the colonial governor. \n \nWhether the chief executive 'transcends'\u00a0all else or not, Zhang's remarks alone do not mean the chief executive's position has been lifted to that of an emperor \n \nFirst, by the Hong Kong Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, the governor was the representative of the British monarch, accountable only to the king or queen. Under Article 43 of the Basic Law, the chief executive is accountable to both the central government and the SAR government. \n \nSecond, the governor was free to reject laws passed by Legco and was free to dissolve the legislature. Under Article 50 of the Basic Law, the chief executive has only very limited power in this regard. \n \nThird, there was no mechanism for the impeachment of the governor.

It was a place she loved very much, but at the moment it will always be somewhere that reminds her of what Lachlan did. But, down the line, who knows what might happen?\" \n\r \nSo is there not even a small part of her that wants to stay? \"No, absolutely not. She misses her sister, but not everything else. They're also dealing with Val's death, which is bleak and upsetting, especially for Jacob. So it's become a dark place for her, whereas Portugal is lovely and sunny. Over there, she felt like she had a future again.\" \n\r \nDavid has, of course, been preoccupied with looking out for his grieving dad Eric's welfare. But viewers - and Alicia - know that he would in fact do anything to stay in the village and not return overseas. And, in the end, it's only when David's mask slips that the whole truth comes out. \n\r \n\"Alicia loves David deeply, but she's becoming frustrated with him because she wants him to have the courage to say that he never wanted to go to Portugal and doesn't want to go back,\" continues Anderson. \"She feels like he's using his dad as an excuse. She would have more respect for him if he just came out and said it. Then when he does, that stresses her out a lot.\" \n    \r   \nAs for Anderson, the storyline marks the end of her five years on the ITV soap. \"The fans have been so kind,\" she says. \"I've had lots of messages saying that they can't believe I'm leaving. Prior to the helicopter crash, there was a lot of speculation that Alicia would die. I've been overwhelmed by the support that the fans have shown both me and my on-screen family.\" \n\r \nAnd who is she going to miss the most? \"Everyone! Obviously my girls - Roxy Shahidi, Fiona Wade and Gaynor Faye. I'll miss them deeply. But obviously my family as well.

Many people avidly follow their favorite football teams during the fall. The law firm of Hardison & Cochran, Attorneys at Law, wants to channel some of that energy to raise awareness of autism, a common developmental disability. \n\nBen Cochran, managing partner of the Raleigh law firm, announced today the firm is joining forces with the Autism Society of North Carolina and Carolina Football to increase understanding of autism, a brain disorder with widely varying effects, and the needs of those affected by it. \n\n\"We're excited to be partners with the Autism Society of North Carolina and Carolina Athletics again this football season to raise autism awareness in the Tar Heel State,\" Cochran said. \"Our mission is to help North Carolina families. Improving public understanding of autism certainly fits with that.\" \n\nHardison & Cochran and the Autism Society of North Carolina will serve as co-sponsors of the Tar Heels' first home game against the North Carolina A&T Aggies, set for 6 p.m. September 12 at Kenan Stadium in Chapel Hill. Autism Society staff members will be available on game day to answer people's questions about autism, which affects tens of thousands of people across North Carolina. \n\nIn addition to the game sponsorship, Hardison & Cochran will sponsor commercials highlighting autism awareness during Carolina football radio broadcasts as well as on Head Coach Larry Fedora's television show. The firm also will purchase advertising in the program to be sold to fans at this year's home games. \n\nAutism is a developmental disability that affects a person's behavior skills as well as their ability to communicate and interact socially. \n\nAccording to the Autism Society, more than 60,000 North Carolina residents cope with the Autism Spectrum Disorder, which refers to a group of developmental disabilities affecting a person's capacity to grasp what they see, hear and sense, such as classic autism, Asperger's syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). \n\nNorth Carolina's incidence of autism is higher than the national rate, with 1 in 58 people born with the disorder compared to 1 of 68 children across the country, according to the Autism Society of North Carolina. \n\nDiscounted tickets for $10 to the Tar Heels-Aggies Autism Awareness Game are available.

{"id":"eb4ab581-92a4-4e0c-8ff0-8c486455a87e","content":"Rocker Ryan Adams said covering Taylor Swift's entire \"1989\" album was \"incredibly humbling\" and helped him explore himself more deeply as a musician. \n\nAdams' version of \"1989\" was digitally released Monday. Swift released the original album \u2014 her first full-blown pop record \u2014 last October. \n\n\"It's actually incredibly humbling to find a connection with someone else's words and someone else's songs and to open yourself up and to feel them fully, and find out where those stories take you,\" Adams, 40, said in an interview last week. \"It felt no less genuine than any song I've ever written for myself.\" \n\nSo far, Swift's fifth album has sold 5.2 million units and launched multiple hits, including No.1s like \"Shake It Off,\" \"Blank Space\" and \"Bad Blood.\" Adams' interpretation of \"1989\" offers a slowed-down take on her upbeat anthems. \n\n\"I got to work different parts of my brain, different parts of my heart and different parts of the musical aspects of my personality,\" Adams said of covering Swift's music. \"It's really its own thing. ...It's not the same record.\" \n\nAfter completing his version, the singer-songwriter-producer played it for 25-year-old Swift before taking it any further.

In fact, New research, Expedia Value Tracker, reveals the best value spots for a Christmas trip overseas, and even the US figures as a possibility. That's because currency fluctuations are not the only monetary movement to factor in. Changes in accommodation, flight and living costs all contribute to the value of a holiday.\n\nFor instance, New Zealand is the only destination where the Australian dollar currently goes further than it did a year ago, up four per cent year-on-year. But the average accommodation cost there has risen nine per cent, while average flight prices between NZ and Australia have decreased five per cent. That all adds up to Expedia considering New Zealand the best value option for Aussies right now.\n\nAs for the US, the fact that flight costs have dipped 10 per cent in the past year offsets the dollar drop of 21 per cent and counting \u2013 a little. Expedia says travellers might find better value across the border in Canada this year, where the Australian dollar has only fallen six per cent against the Canadian dollar and flights decreased by six per cent year-on-year. That's especially relevant for those considering a Christmas ski break.\n\nExpedia Australia and NZ managing director MD George Ruebensal suggests, however, you think creatively. \"If travellers are flexible about where they go, there are opportunities to save. And when thinking about Europe, that's exciting as there are so many amazing places to explore. For instance, why not consider Norway where the Aussie dollar has gained ground against the Norwegian krone and average hotel and flight prices have also decreased.\"\n\nThe Aussie has also gained more than 30 per cent against the Russian ruble.\n\nNo time to monitor it all?

{"id":"c3422aeb-565f-48fe-87bf-beb34963883a","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 Time and time again Serena Williams escaped during this Grand Slam season on her quest to sweep all four majors. But finally, on Friday, she hit a roadblock that caused her not just to trip, but to fall.\n\nThat hurdle came in the most unlikely of forms in Roberta Vinci, a 32-year-old world No. 43 who was making her debut appearance in a Grand Slam semifinal.\n\nIt also came in the form of unthinkable pressure loaded onto the shoulders of the 33-year-old world No. 1, who was trying to sweep all four majors in a calendar year for the first time since 1988, when Steffi Graf did so.\n\n\"I don't think we can understand the scale of what she felt,\" said Leif Shiras, a TV commentator for British broadcaster Sky Sports and former player in an interview. \"It's tough to play against history. You have to feel like her loss is a symptom of that pressure.\"\n\nWilliams swatted away any suggestion that her Friday demise \u2014 after 26 Grand Slam match wins this year and 33 dating to Wimbledon last season \u2014 was due to expectation of the moment.\n\n\"I told you guys I don't feel pressure,\" a tired Williams told reporters in a news conference. \"I never felt pressure. \u2026 I never felt that pressure to win here. I said that from the beginning.\"\n\nFrom the beginning of 2015, however, Williams' drive for the Grand Slam has been a fragile, bumpy one. At the French Open she worked through five three-setters, the most of any major in her career; at Wimbledon she trailed Heather Watson by two breaks in the third set in the third round; a week ago Bethanie Mattek-Sands had her on the ropes in a night match.\n\nEach time, a Serena 'W;' but not today.\n\n\"Today was not a good day,\" her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, told a small group of reporters, saying Williams woke up feeling off.\n\n\"Players are humans,\" he continued. \"How many times did it happen this year where she felt like this and she still found her way through? She didn't find her way today.\"\n\nEven Vinci, undone by Williams four times (all in straight sets) coming in, could see the most feared opponent in tennis looking tentative, double faulting, yelling at herself to find a way.\n\n\"(In) my mind, I say, 'Think about this, she's nervous,'\" a smiling Vinci said. \"So I tried to keep fighting for every single point.\"\n\n\"It was apparent to all of us who have watched her for 20 years that she was nervous today,\" Chris Evert said plainly on ESPN.\n\nIt was a different kind of match than most of her three-setters at the majors, however. Seven times she had come back from dropping the first set. But only once in a three-set match did she drop the second \u2013 as she did Friday \u2013 and then right herself.\n\nIn the third set against Vinci, Williams appeared lost and at times confounded, however. She barked at herself at one moment, all of Arthur Ashe yelling shouts of encouragement. The next, she was quieting herself \u2014 palm towards the ground \u2014 trying to stay calm.\n\n\"I was just trying to win points at that point and win the match,\" she explained.\n\nOne shouldn't underestimate the emotional impact of the Slam, Shiras said.\n\n\"The toll of this journey she was on was too much for her today,\" Shiras said. \"She was trying to dig deep and the way to generate energy for her is to get that passion out. But I think that can tire her; there is an element of fatigue that plays into this story. She was at a breaking point; she was boiling. And Vinci was drawing that out of her. It was amazing drama.\"\n\nThe pressure finally got to Serena Williams and killed her Grand Slam dream\n\nDrama with a twist: On this day, the 21-time major champion, chasing history in front of a home crowd, with more power on her racket than anyone in the game was on the losing end. A defeat with a capital 'D.'\n\n\"Every loss is difficult,\" Mouratoglou said. \"I think she lost her way mentally. Tactically she didn't know what to do. When you make the wrong choices, you lose the points you're supposed to win and then you make more and more wrong choices. She lost her way on the path tactically.\"\n\nA road that started in Melbourne ends in New York \u2014 and not in the way Williams imagined.\n\nPHOTOS: All the action at the U.S. Open semifinals","title":"Coach: Serena lost her way mentally and tactically","media-type":"News","source":"USA Today","published":"2015-09-12T00:57:12Z"}

It is a widely used term that includes fertilizers and pesticides. Agrochemicals help to increase the productivity of the crops by supplying needed nutrients and providing protection from various diseases, without harming the environment. Thus, the focus of industry players is not only to develop and launch agrochemicals, but also to train its end-users about the proper use of these chemicals. The tightening environmental regulations in developed regions such as North America and Europe are making it difficult for the manufacturers to sell their conventional products in these regions. Hence, they are bound to develop new products that fulfill environmental norms. It has, thus, become important for them to find a right balance between the product performance and content of their product.\n\nEarly buyers will receive 10% customization on reports. According to the estimates, Asia-Pacific leads the market for Agrochemicals with 41.3% share in demand at global level in 2012, followed by Latin America (17.0%), North America (15.4%), Europe (7.8%), and Rest of the World (18.5%). Looking at fertilizers type, Nitrogenous fertilizers occupied 68.4% and Organophosphates occupied 73.0% share in demand in their respective agrochemicals type.\n\nThe growth of the Agrochemicals Market has been studied through in-depth analysis of major factors that are driving the market such as growing population and increase in demand for food with opportunities in the development of environment friendly and rising consumer awareness for agrochemicals. However, the increasing environmental concerns and availability of other environment friendly alternatives are proving to be the major restraining factors for the market.

The new Prime Minister says he will not be moving to Kirribilli House, but is staying put at his red-clay-coloured home in Point Piper, with its own fetching harbour views.\n\nTwo days after his swearing in ceremony last Monday, a big yellow crane appeared behind his house for building work at a neighbouring property.\n\nThere are at least five major construction and renovation projects underway in the neighbourhood, which comes to life in the early morning hours with the arrival of tradesmen in orange tops and fluorescent green socks tucked inside work boots.\n\nThe constant hum of the towering crane that swings large skips full of boulders precariously close to the Turnbull rooftop is punctuated by loud beeping and a cacophony of roaring saws, drills and cement mixers.\n\nTwo Australian Federal Police officers sit quietly inside a grey car parked outside the residence.

{"id":"164094dd-4fc8-4e63-8169-cb438de61f10","content":"Auckland News.Net  Thursday 17th September, 2015  \n U.S. Ambassador to India, Richard Verma, has said that the developments of the past year show that India is determined to emerge from its slumber as the second sleeping giant of Asia and reclaim its historical position as one of the great world powers. \n\"Indian leaders have expressed a determination to leave behind the traditions of non-alignment and strategic autonomy and, in the words of Foreign Secretary Jaishankar, to become a 'leading power',\" he added. \n \nVerma said the strategic partnership between India and the US will be unlike the geo-political alliances of the 20th century. \n \n\"Rather than remaining confined to one corner of our planet, we will work to uphold the global systems and spaces that will allow for the continued advancement of humankind. In the words of Prime Minister Modi the great promise of the U.S.-India relationship is what both countries \"can do together for the world.\" To be sure, the U.S.-India strategic partnership will be anchored in Asia,\" said Verma. \n \n\"But it will also be a truly 21st century relationship of natural allies working together in cyberspace, global hotspots, outer space, the human genome and the global biome,\" he added. \n \nAsserting that India is seeking to make up for lost time, the US envoy said India is still grappling with a legacy of systemic economic challenges that have hampered its growth in comparison to other Asian powers in the 20th century. \n \n\"However, India has exerted a profound historical impact on the global economy, and is poised to do so again. For much of recorded history, until the 18th century in fact, India's GDP matched or exceeded that of China and dwarfed production in Europe,\" said Verma. \n \n\"As the birthplace of Buddhism and a historical center of Sufi Islam, India's cultural influence extends from Southeast Asia to Mongolia and from Indonesia to the steppes of Central Asia,\" he added. \n \nThe US envoy said the relationship between New Delhi and Washington will serve as an important new buttress safeguarding open commerce and freedom of navigation in the Asia-Pacific region. \n \n\"Through dialogues such as the U.S.-India East Asia Consultations which the East West Center graciously hosted in June and the U.S.-India -Japan Trilateral Dialogue, we are working together to promote a democratic and rules-based vision for political and economic security in Asia,\" said Verma in his remarks on \"An Alliance for Global Prosperity\" at EWC, Hawaii. \n \n\"But our bilateral relationship will be much more far-reaching. The U.S. and Indian governments are engaging agricultural professionals from Kenya, Malawi and Liberia to improve food security in their countries by increasing crop yields using new technologies,\" he added. \n \nThe US envoy said India's generic pharmaceutical industry and highly skilled biotechnology workforce will be essential to addressing the greatest health challenges in all countries across the economic spectrum. \n \n\"Our countries are exchanging findings from current Mars missions and are sharing ideas about future explorations. Prime Minister Modi recently hosted the third USAID-supported Call to Action Summit to end preventable maternal and child deaths,\" said Verma. \n \n\"The United States and India have joined forces to advance a multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and are working to bring together industry, academia and regulators in both our countries in support of this vision. These are just a few examples that show how the scope of our alliance will not limited by geography or sector but will encompass the full spectrum of human endeavor,\" he added. \n \nVerma said as the Indian governments have come and gone the ideal of a multiethnic democracy has remained at the very core of the national consciousness. \n \n\"In this way India was perhaps the first truly 21st century country. In the decades after 1947, the freedom riders who were trained in Gandhi's ideals and methods, and in some cases in India by Gandhi's associates themselves, helped the United States begin to come to terms with our own history of injustice, providing the reconciliation that allowed for our post-Cold War prosperity and influence,\" he added. \n \nVerma said the commitment to a democratic system and the rule of law that have made India an island of stability in a continent that has seen tremendous upheaval in the past 50 years will continue to provide the Indian people the platform on which to construct their 21st century emergence. \n \n\"That India has lifted millions out of poverty and many of its 1.2 billion people have prospered while living under a transparent system of government demonstrates that the principles both countries hold dear are not \"American\" or \"Asian\" but human aspirations,\" said Verma. \n \n\"This shared view of a government that is inclusive and accountable to its people has resulted in India, despite its considerable economic challenges, leading the pack in a number of key indicators. Indian citizens are among the world's most numerous and active social media users - much has been written about the Indian impact on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram,\" he added. \n \nThe US envoy said the Indian innovators are among the most successful and prolific patent applicants in the world, and Indian companies, drawing on a highly educated English speaking workforce, are deeply integrated into global business processing. \n \n\"Recent controversies notwithstanding, India's civil society is composed of tens of thousands of vocal and active NGOs that are influencing policy and budgets around the country. In this century, the advancement of prosperity will require the ability to nurture innovations, energize global audiences with new ideas and build cross-cultural understanding,\" said Verma. \n \n\"I need only to consider the number of Indian citizens using Facebook on cell phones charged by village entrepreneurs selling solar power to be certain that India is primed to succeed in these challenges,\" he added.

{"id":"c27a162d-f2d1-4bdb-84ba-0915a082775b","content":"NBC's new drama The Player  has one of the most ridiculous premises of any of the new fall TV shows -- but that's not a bad thing. Unlike so many of the shows trying to \"cut through the clutter\" with a splashy concept, The Player knows exactly what it wants to be: a high-octane crime thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously. And it shouldn't with a setup like this: Alex Kane ( Philp Winchester ) is a private security specialist in Las Vegas who, after the murder of his wife Ginny ( Daisy Betts ), is pulled into a long-running conspiracy involving the richest people in the world gambling on crime. With the help of \"pit boss\" Mr. Johnson ( Wesley Snipes ) and \"the dealer\" Cassandra ( Charity Wakefield ), Alex, as \"the player,\" tries to stop crimes while the fat cats in \"the house\" bet on or against his ability to save the day. Got all that? \"We knew we wanted to make a pulp show,\" co-creator John Rogers tells TVGuide.com . \"The way pulp works is to find a good, simple, defining metaphor, and we said, 'What are the elements of gambling?' If you're going to have a conspiracy, you're going to have code names, you're going to a have a structure. When we looked at the basic form of gambling, the feel of a casino, and it just came very naturally. People understand those terms -- millions of people gamble. We're not introducing obscure vocabulary to explain our very high-concept, obscure conspiracy.\" Fall Preview: Check out all the must-watch new shows But it was also important for Rogers to have some emotional context beneath all the Las Vegas window-dressing. \"Everyone right now feels as if maybe the rules were changed on them,\" Rogers says. \"You sent your kids to college, but somehow your college graduate is living in your basement because he can't get a job. It feels like we're trapped in a game that somebody changed the rules. We said, 'Why don't we externalize that? Why don't we talk about the fact we are trapped in a game, and there's one guy in the middle of it who is on our side?' That gave us the emotional stakes of the show.\" Page 2 of 3 - For Alex, his journey is entirely fueled by the heartbreak he feels over the death of his wife. \"Trying to resolve how Ginny died and why she died and who's responsible, is the primary emotional thrust of his investigation,\" Rogers says. \"That's the thing that keeps him going back undercover into this organization.\" And continuing to go back in is an issue. After all, the whole concept of a group of people profiting off of crime rather than trying to prevent it is pretty icky, right? \"They're doing a horrible thing,\" Rogers says with a laugh. \"It allows us to have some fun every week, but they're plainly bad guys. Alex is a good guy in the middle of a bad system. One of the essential questions of the show is: Is that system actually the best possible system that we can live with?\" Because of Alex's unease about what he's doing, The Player is unlike most procedurals where the team is one big happy family. Instead, when, in the pilot, Alex threatens to kill Mr. Johnson one day in the not-too-distant future, you're inclined to believe him. However, the team still has to rely on each other, regardless of how much they trust their colleagues. \"Everyone has their own agenda, everyone has their own secret plan, and everyone has their own sort of shifting allegiances,\" Rogers says. \"They are in a life-and-death world, and they have to trust each other as far as they can to not die, but never trust each other enough to make themselves vulnerable.\" The Player 's Wesley Snipes and more familiar faces in new places That central conflict will certainly begin to define Mr. Johnson's moral ambiguity, which is exactly what attracted Snipes to the role. \"I get to explore some character work in a way that I probably couldn't in a feature film,\" Snipes says. \"You never know which side he's playing for. You'll learn quickly that Mr. Johnson knows secrets that no one else knows. He's seen a lot of players come and go, and this guy is nothing special at this point. Or so we make it appear. Mr. Johnson has another card that he hasn't played yet. There's a whole deck that Mr. Johnson hasn't played yet.\" However, Rogers is quick to caution people from deciding outright that Mr. Johnson is the bad guy. \"There are weeks that Mr. Johnson does something heroic because it fits his sense of personal ethics, and you're like, 'Yeah, I love Mr. Johnson!'\" Rogers says. \"Then, there are days that he's the most horrible human being in the world. I don't know if you ever want to be rooting for him, but you should be fascinated by him. ... His views on power are not necessarily wrong, they're just horrible.\" Page 3 of 3 - Then again, Alex isn't an entirely noble hero either. \"He's saving lives. He genuinely enjoys the work, but Alex Kane has a problem. He is a man with a high capacity for violence and a tendency towards it,\" Rogers says. \"To a great degree the two themes for the show are power and addiction. We all have behaviors we're drawn to. We all have those things we can't let go of, be it Ginny's death or the constant fall into violence which comes very easily to him. We all have these desires that are beyond our control, and how we deal with them to a great degree is what defines us.\" Although the show is clearly reveling in its procedural makeup (\"I love the one-and-done of it,\" Rogers confesses), the writers are telling a longer story. However, the central mystery of Ginny's murder, which gets much more messy by the end of the pilot, won't be stretched out forever. \"The mystery of how that happened, who did it, why it was done -- all of that is meant to be an important thing that we reveal to the audience over the course of the first 12 episodes,\" Rogers says. \"We're not going to hold you over a barrel for five years. Most of the questions in the first season will be resolved by the end of the first season.\" The Player premieres Thursday at 10\/9c on NBC. Will you watch?

Read\u2026 \r \nTim Ernst grew up in Williamsville playing video games like \u201cMega Man\u201d and \u201cThe Legend of Zelda\u201d on his console, and \u201cUltima\u201d and \u201cWarcraft\u201d on his computer. \n\n\u201cI loved them. They were something I just saw so much potential in,\u201d Ernst said. \u201cIt was always heartbreaking to play a game that was terrible. And if you played one that was amazing, it was just an unbelievable experience. \n\n\u201d \n\nToday, he gets to play \u2013 and design, and develop \u2013 video games for a living. Ernst, 34, is general manager of Kabam Games, where he oversees about 100 employees in the company\u2019s San Francisco development studio. \n\nHe\u2019s playing a leading role in the company\u2019s latest mobile game, \u201cStar Wars: Uprising,\u201d which came out Thursday and is tied to the eagerly awaited next installment in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie franchise, set for release in December. \n\nKabam has found a niche in making interactive, role-playing games for smartphones and tablets. The games are free to download and play but offer users the chance to pay for additional items within the game. \n\nIt\u2019s one segment of the massive, highly competitive video-game market, in which Ernst got his start with an internship at Ubisoft while studying at Yale University. He later worked at Sega of America and Bedlam Games before joining Kabam four years ago. \n\nThe Canisius High School graduate spoke to The News during a recent trip to Western New York, where he visited family and tried to squeeze in stops at Duff\u2019s Famous Wings, Gabriel\u2019s Gate, Mighty Taco, Wegmans and other hometown favorites. \n\nQ: Is making video games work? \n\nA: Clearly we\u2019re not just playing games. We, to a certain extent, do rocket science inside of video games. But it\u2019s sure enjoyable \u2013 it\u2019s an industry full of passionate people. \n\nQ: Kabam\u2019s niche is in role-playing games, or RPGs, for mobile devices. What are they? \n\nA: A role-playing game is really a video game world. It\u2019s got to be complete, with people you talk to, a story. But your character, your customization, your choices, as well as how you interact with both people in the game, and other people playing the game, is what makes the genre unique. \n\nQ: Are role-playing games a small part of the market compared to console and PC games? \n\nA: No, it is it not a small segment of the overall industry. In fact, multiple games last year made over $1 billion themselves. So, there has been success. And the people that have been successful have stayed at the top for a long period of time. It\u2019s also a growth market because of international \u2013 specifically China. China\u2019s a huge market that console games, traditional games, have not been able to break into. \n\nQ: How do you provide the immersed gaming experience you get from playing on a desktop or console to people playing on their phones? \n\nA: That\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re trying to pioneer. We just released a game seven months ago called \u201cMarvel: Contest of Champions,\u201d which is a fighting game that had some light story elements. And really it\u2019s about making it a game \u2013 it\u2019s not a mobile game being an apology. So we\u2019re trying to push more the true, classic video game experiences inside of a phone. And that does mean that if we\u2019re making an RPG (role playing game), we have to tell our story a little differently \u2013 our pacing\u2019s very different. \n\nQ: \u201cStar Wars: Uprising\u201d will be free to download and play. How does Kabam make money through the game? \n\nA: The basis of free to play is everybody can download it because we want as many people as possible to start playing it. And, really, the core of free play is being able to offer people what we call \u201cpay against the grind.\u201d So if you want to do something in the game, and it\u2019s going to take you a couple of extra hours \u2013 it\u2019s not like a timer, but let\u2019s say I have to run 10 dungeons \u2013 there\u2019s a route to kind of make that a lot shorter. It\u2019s optional. \n\nQ: How does the game fit within the \u201cStar Wars\u201d storyline? \n\nA: \u201cStar Wars: Uprising\u201d is set in the Anoat Sector, which you could call the \u201cEmpire Strikes Back\u201d sector. So it\u2019s Hoth, Cloud City, the planets around there. And it\u2019s right after \u201cReturn of the Jedi.\u201d So this is time that nobody has explored in games. Basically, after the emperor, Death Star II, and the emperor is killed, the governor of the system, Governor Adelhard, basically puts an iron blockade down. Now, he\u2019s an imperialist. He believes that what the Empire\u2019s doing is truly great for the galaxy. And he puts a blockade that prevents trade, that prevents rebel propaganda. But ultimately you\u2019re pushing back against Adelhard\u2019s iron blockade. And there\u2019s five factions. The Rebel Alliance is one of the factions. \n\nQ: Is it completely open-ended, or is there a way to win the game? \n\nA: I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s winning, because it\u2019s a living world. But clearly you want to win, you want to beat the Empire. And we don\u2019t really look at it as just a game or a packaged product. This is a service, and we want to create the Star Wars community, the place for everyone to live their \u201cStar Wars\u201d dream. So how you push back against the Empire is part of the game, and one of the parts that will evolve. And as the community reacts, t\u2026","title":"A video game fan brings \u2018Star Wars\u2019 to your smartphone","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-13T02:09:48Z"}

But the market was rocked by volatility in the past two weeks, triggered by fears of slowing growth in China.\n\nSome investors believe the market turmoil, which left the S&P 500 with its biggest monthly drop in three years in August, may lead the Fed to delay a rate hike until the end of the year.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility index .VIX, known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge\", fell 1.65 percent to 25.64 on Thursday, slightly above the long-term average of 20. The index had spiked as much as 53.29 early last week.\n\nAt 2:53 pm, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 0.37 percent to 16,412.58 and the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.41 percent to 1,956.93.

On the Nasdaq, 1,530 issues rose and 1,236 fell.\n\nThe S&P 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 28 new highs and 32 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Tanya Agrawal; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Chizu Nomiyama)","title":"Wall Street higher ahead of key U.S. jobs data","media-type":"News","source":"Yahoo!

There\u2019s a rap interlude from Lunch Money Lewis; a sexy duet with pop star Jordin Sparks. \n\nThe artist blaring from the speakers sat just outside the listening session \u2014 too nervous, he said, to watch people take in tracks from his sophomore album \u2018Tangled Up.\u2019 He strides in when it\u2019s over, bedroom eyes scanning the room for a reaction. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d the group initially declares before the question on everyone\u2019s mind gets asked. \n\nThe son of 90\u2019s country singer and Nashville songwriter Rhett Akins, Rhett made his debut in 2013 with \u2018bro\u2019 songs like \u2018Get Me Some of That\u2019 and \u2018It Goes Like This\u2019 \u2014 his star seemingly reliant on the dirt road theme of the day. But in the past year, Rhett\u2019s undergone a metamorphosis: first with his BeeGees-inspired \u2018Make Me Wanna\u2019 and then with \u2018Crash & Burn,\u2019 the Sam Cooke-style debut single off a forthcoming record that marries soul, pop, disco, electronic dance music (EDM) and a dash of rap with what\u2019s typically known as country. \n\nThe single Rhett was terrified to release has since become his fastest rising, biggest selling song. And nestled in the Country Billboard Top 10 this summer betwixt hits like Sam Hunt\u2019s party-hearty \u2018House Party\u2019 and \u2018Like a Wrecking Ball,\u2019 the soulful sex-jam from Erich Church, his risk at least feels of the moment. There is comfort in acknowledging the chart-busting success of genre-blurring acts like Florida Georgia Line (who Rhett has supported on tour), Luke Bryan and Hunt, whose nearly pure-pop and R&B debut album has made him something of a (controversial) pioneer. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very liberating\u201d Rhett said in an interview, reflecting on his move away from \u201cbro\u201d and towards something entirely new. \u201cSomeone the other day was like \u2018Man, I don\u2019t know if you know this, but I feel like you\u2019re on the brink of leading a new direction of music. \n\n\u2019\u201d \n\nBut in the minds of traditionalists, a new direction isn\u2019t something to which a country musician should aspire. To guys like Kyle Coroneos, who runs the website SavingCountryMusic.com, country is a genre not to be tampered with. Country music is about preserving tradition. It always has been and always will be. \n\nHe calls this disco\/EDM iteration a \u201cbro-hangover.\u201d The idea that bringing other genre-influences into country right now is risky, or pushing the envelope, or taking the genre somewhere new and exciting is disingenuous, he says. Instead, it contributes to one giant \u201cmono-genre,\u201d which he believes the merging of hip-hop and country has become. \n\n\u201cThe risk for country music is when you start going this far out of your boundaries, you begin to lose control of the music, you begin to lose control of your identity,\u201d he said. \u201cCountry music is unique because it has so much of its own infrastructure and traditions \u2014 no other genre of music has four major awards shows every year, not even rock or EDM or rap. \n\n\u201d \n\nThe genre-blending and trend-chasing is exactly the fate that befell rock radio, he said. \u201cIn the 1990s and early 2000s, rock became the catch-all phrase,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat happened was it lost its identity and it sort of imploded. I think it could happen\u201d with country music. \n\nRhett doesn\u2019t believe his music is going to cause the downfall of country music. \u201cWe\u2019re one of those genres that sort of lives in this bubble that everyone is a little bit scared to poke that bubble, because we\u2019re worried about what will happen when that bubble breaks,\u201d said Rhett. \u201cTo me, I want to be that artist that when my buddies are watching me side-stage, they\u2019ll say \u2018Dang, I can\u2019t believe they just did that in their concert.\u2019 Or they hear a song on the record and go \u2018How in the world did they cut that song and get away with it?\u2019 There\u2019s something kind of rebelliously fun about it. \n\n\u201d \n\nHe cites mainstream country rebel Church as inspiration, his latest rock-influenced record \u2018The Outsiders\u2019 is stacked with successful radio hits, despite its many middle-finger-to-the-man moments. But in the minds of critics, that rebelliousness is a far cry from the stuff of Willie & Waylon and more indicative of Nashville chasing the next biggest money-making thing. \n\nDespite all of the pop experimentation, the country music genre lives in two stubborn solitudes: There\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 country and there\u2019s that crap you hear on the radio. But if you\u2019re going to refer to something as \u2018real\u2019 country, you have to have a definition of what \u2018real\u2019 country is. \n\nIf Thomas Rhett wants to put out an album in the style of Bruno Mars and have EDM and R&B stuff \u2026 I am 100% for it. You go, Thomas Rhett. You do that. But don\u2019t do it and sell it to country fans \n\nCountry music\u2019s identity is very much rooted in geography \u2014 there\u2019s Texas Swing out of the Lone Star State; there\u2019s Kentucky bluegrass, there\u2019s The Bakersfield Sound in California, which was a grittier, more direct response to the slick sounds coming out of Countrypolitan Nashville. \n\nPerhaps the current outcry of traditionalists is a little reminiscent of the origins of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2014 the combination of blues, country and gospel broke all the rules in the 1950s and pushed so many gatekeeper buttons. While Rhett\u2019s hip gyrations are the closest he\u2019ll ever get to Elvis, maybe his Bruno Mars covers are indeed pushing the boundaries in a good way \u2014 reminding the country music world that nothing ever new or interesting has come from colouring inside the lines. \n\nAnd if there would be no rock \u2018n roll without blues, country and gospel, there would be no co\u2026","title":"Thomas Rhett pulls a Swift: Is country music\u00a0still country music when rap, soul and EDM are included?","media-type":"News","source":"MyInforms","published":"2015-09-14T16:24:01Z"}
{"id":"c9a210b1-7993-4c6a-b911-fbea4c6ef154","content":"In her Wexner retrospective, filmmaker Penelope Spheeris excavates her iconic and primal past  \nIt was Black Flag squatting in a dilapidated church.\u00a0 Darby Crash muttering his classic \u201cpuzzled panther\u201d musings.\u00a0A coked-up Ozzy cooking an egg, or the infamous scene\u00a0 of W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes chugging straight\u00a0 vodka from his swimming pool as his mother looks on. \n \nDirector Penelope Spheeris\u2019 iconic Decline of Western Civilization series of documentaries were fly-on-the-wall portraits of the Los Angeles\u2019 subcultures in full bloom\u2014and in mid-decay. \n \nBut for the longest time, save the occasional midnight screening or happened upon bootleg VHS copy, the Decline films and their raw portrayal of the burgeoning punk and metal scenes were never given their proper due in the age of the DVD. That\u2019s all about to change with the Shout! Factory re-issues of the entire trilogy, filled with hours and hours of extras giving Spheeris a closure to her work. There were no copyright issues or finagling with bands wanting a chunk of change in their twilight years\u2014it was simply a matter of Spheeris feeling instinctively unnerved at watching her life pass before her. It was footage she couldn\u2019t handle watching. \n \nSpeaking with a very confident and still invigorated Spheeris, it was apparent she knows her arena as a filmmaker. Despite being responsible for hits such as Wayne\u2019s World , Black Sheep , and, to a lesser degree, The Little Rascals , it\u2019s the Decline films that have become her calling card and life\u2019s work. The only way to convey her enthusiasm about her upcoming visit to the Wexner Center to introduce the landmark first film is through our brief, but enlightening conversation. \n \nGrowing up around a lot of cultural shifts, during The Decline of Western Civilization , you were in your mid-30s. Were you a part of that scene? What drew you to document that particular punk scene in Los Angeles? I had been going to those punk clubs. I was definitely a part of the scene and I knew most of the people in the movie before I decided to make a movie. I was older, but I think I was still working out my childhood issues and I saw their childhood issues and decided to make a film about it. \n \nSpeaking of childhoods, I truly feel that the film shaped the way I appreciate music and what I appreciate, so that\u2019s a really good answer.  Good. That\u2019s good to hear. \n \nI guess the same question is relevant for The Decline of Western Civilization II: The Metal Years , which was made seven years later. Were you equally attracted to the metal scene in Los Angeles, or were you just playing the role of documentarian?  I\u2019ll have to be honest with you. I was going to those clubs too. I wouldn\u2019t have made that movie if I wasn\u2019t a part of that scene as well. I\u2019m ashamed to admit that I was a part of that scene. \n \nYou shouldn\u2019t be ashamed. I think in a lot of ways, those first two films were blueprints for their respective scenes, or genres. Especially The Metal Years , where putting a band like London up against clips of Ozzy and Kiss posed an interesting juxtaposition. I haven\u2019t talked about this much, because with these re-releases I didn\u2019t want to watch any of it. I was forced to watch this again. I couldn\u2019t handle it. But when I look at them I see so many aspects of attitude and style and trends that are still prevalent to everyday life. When I filmed them, they were unique. \n \nJust the jargon even, the language\u2026 the word \u201cheadbanging\u201d for instance. I love the part when the audience members are explaining to you just exactly what \u201cheadbanging\u201d entailed.  Yeah. I think that was eventually a cemented part of our culture with the \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d scene in Wayne\u2019s World . At the same time, it kind of killed the authenticity of something that was once an honest part of a culture. \n \nI didn\u2019t want to even touch Wayne\u2019s World and just focus on the Decline films, but I do think that for you, Wayne\u2019s World may have been this zenith of punk and metal\u2014like your ironic raspberry towards what was then considered \u201calternative.\u201d  I think I got to do Wayne\u2019s World because of The Metal Years . There wasn\u2019t anyone else who was a director in Hollywood who knew anything about that music either way. Plus I knew Lorne Michaels. It changed my life. I kind of wished I hadn\u2019t made it only because I could have made the films I wanted to make but then I would\u2019ve been broke. But yeah, it pokes fun at a lot from my past.\u201d \n \nFor me, seeing the original Decline was a sort of cultural gauntlet. I was 13 and watching from a dubbed VHS copy. Did you have the foresight when you made it that it could be that type of landmark for that scene and that music?  Well there was a guy in Singapore the other day who asked me how the kids in the third Decline could have seen the first Decline since it wasn\u2019t available, but you just explained it. What happened was, even though it wasn\u2019t available it became an underground contraband and established it that way. \n \nIs there any kind of subculture or counter-culture that you see currently that is vital? Something that you would like to expose or document? What is IV?  The answer to that and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand, is that today everyone has a camera. I hate to say the subject matter because of that, because anyone can go and make that movie now. But somewhere deep down in the bottom of the hard drive of one of those movies is the beginning of Decline IV . I\u2019m looking forward to doing it and people are always for it. \n \nSpheeris will introduce the original Decline of Western Civilization on Friday, October 23 at the Wexner Center at 7 p.m. Parts II and III will screen on Saturday, October 25 at 2 p.m.","title":"Punk\u2019s Not Passed","media-type":"News","source":"614columbus.com","published":"2015-09-25T17:29:04Z"}

Therefore, it is expected that the president of Pakistan would cease the use of the premises of Presidency for political meetings of his party,\u201d the four-judge bench of the LHC had said in its order on a petition filed by senior lawyer A.K.

In Bahrain, as well as around the world, globalization has entered a new phase, posing greater challenges for anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) compliance than ever before. Two factors are creating new issues for companies, according to a recent report by KPMG International.\n\nFirst, a growing number of governments around the world are tightening ABC regulations or introducing new ones as we see in Bahrain. In the light of Kingdom\u2019s expanding corporate culture, the government has introduced Law Number 01\/2013 to expand the Amiri Decree Number 15\/1976, in order to address bribery and corruption across both the public and private sectors. Second, as companies globalize their operations, they rely more heavily on third parties than before to do business in far-flung parts of the world, often in areas where there is a high risk of corruption. said: \u201cthe government has worked hard to enforce strict laws on bribery and corruption. However, as the global report highlights, with GCC based organizations and businesses increasingly investing overseas, reliance on and managing risk with third parties can be a challenge and adequate controls and monitoring must be put in place.\u201d \n\nThe survey, conducted by KPMG International with respondents from around the world, shows that companies are rising to the challenge but that a great deal more needs to be done to create a sturdy ABC compliance structure. For full details, read the report . The main findings of the survey include:\n\n\u201cDespite greater efforts to build ABC frameworks, it\u2019s clear that there are gaping holes in them,\u201d says Petrus Marais, Global Leader of Forensic Services for KPMG. \u201cThe problem is particularly acute in the management of third parties who increasingly act as conduits for bribes, making it harder to track. Respondents to the survey admit it\u2019s the biggest challenge in the field of ABC, but they are not doing enough to develop a culture of compliance both among their employees and their vendors and other business associates.\u201d \n\nAbout the survey\n\nThe survey targeted 659 respondents covering 64 countries, with 140 respondents based in Central & Eastern Europe (including Russia), 113 in Western European countries (excluding the UK), 105 from the Asia \u2013 Pacific region, 66 respondents in the U.S., 64 from the South American continent (31 in Mexico), 61 in South Africa and 41 in the UK.

Atlas joins previous seed investors Forbion Capital Partners (Forbion) and Omega Funds (Omega) as investors in this funding round.\n\nReplimune, headquartered in Oxford UK and with a significant presence in Cambridge, MA, was founded in April 2015 to develop the next generation of 'oncolytic immunotherapies' for the treatment of cancer.\n\nJason Rhodes, Partner at Atlas, will join the board of Replimune together with Otello Stampacchia and Sander Slootweg of Omega and Forbion, respectively.\n\nOncolytic immunotherapy is an emerging class of cancer therapeutics which exploit the ability of viruses to selectively replicate in and kill tumor tissue, while at the same time inducing a potent, patient-specific, anti-tumor immune response. Oncolytic viruses have the unique ability to generate an autologous immune response to the patient's particular complement of tumor antigens, including neoantigens, with a truly off-the-shelf approach. While clear single agent clinical activity has been achieved with oncolytic immunotherapy, it is anticipated that particular synergy may be observed in combination with immune checkpoint blockade and other immune-modulatory approaches. Immune checkpoint blockade relies on a pre-existing inflamed tumor microenvironment and a pre-existing immune response to tumor neoantigens for clinical activity, which are only present in some patients. Oncolytic immunotherapy can provide both of these and therefore combination of these two proven modalities is particularly logical and attractive.\n\nReplimune is developing novel, proprietary oncolytic immunotherapies intended to improve both the direct anti-tumor effects of selective virus replication and the potency of the immune response to the tumor antigens released. Replimune intends to progress these rapidly through clinical trials and to combine these with checkpoint blockade at an early stage of clinical development.\n\n\"We are at the beginning of the age of immune-oncology and believe that oncolytic viruses will be a powerful component of this emerging therapeutic approach,\" said Jason Rhodes, Partner at Atlas, \"Atlas is very pleased to be working with the exceptional and experienced team at Replimune.\"\n\nRobert Coffin, Replimune CEO (and previously Founder and CSO of BioVex Inc) said \"Replimune is excited to be at the forefront of oncolytic immunotherapy, and to partner with leading healthcare investors such as Atlas, Forbion and Omega in this funding round. The funds raised will allow us to progress our next generation approach through to clinical data in multiple cancer indications, including in combination with checkpoint blockade.\"\n\nIn addition to stand-alone product development, Replimune will pursue a partnering strategy with companies with promising approved or experimental checkpoint blockade or other complementary immuno-oncology drugs.\n\nFor further information contact:\n\nReplimune Ltd\n\ninfo@replimune.com\n\nAtlas Venture\n\nKristen Margeson\n\n+1-857-201-2700\n\nlifesciences@atlasventure.com\n\n400 Technology Square, 10th Floor\n\nCambridge, MA 02139\n\nForbion Capital Partners\n\nSander Slootweg\n\nManaging Partner\n\n+31(0)35-699-3015\n\nSander.Slootweg@forbion.com\n\nOmega Funds\n\ninfo@omegafunds.net\n\nSuite 502\n\n185 Dartmouth St\n\nBoston MA\n\nhttp:\/\/www.omegafunds.net\n\nSOURCE Replimune","title":"Replimune Ltd Raises $30 Million Series A Financing","media-type":"News","source":"Financial Content","published":"2015-09-24T06:05:35Z"}

Bishop has been granted a release from her contract with Hungarian club UNIQA Sopron, and the Capitals are deep in discussions with their incumbent captain.\n\nThe 26-year-old picked up a minor hamstring injury playing for Seattle Storm and was due to head to Hungary next week, but Bishop and Sopron have come to a mutual agreement.\n\nIt is understood the Capitals hope to make an official announcement as early as this week.\n\nBishop dominated the WNBL last year, averaging 23 points and 10.6 rebounds, and was a clear winner of the player of the year.\n\nThe Capitals are very confident Bishop's injury isn't a risk and she will get through the full season.\n\nJust a few weeks ago the Capitals' roster was severely depleted, but they now look very much a finals contender after recruiting shrewdly since.\n\nBishop's recruitment helps ease the Capitals' concerns in the post, as they had been struggling to find a quality replacement after Belgian centre Ann Wauters withdrew late due to family reasons.\n\nStar centre Lauren Jackson, herself returning from knee surgery, is the only specialist post player Canberra currently has on its books.\n\nBut if both stay fit, Jackson and Bishop will from arguably the most imposing front court partnership in the WNBL.\n\nJackson's rehabilitation is progressing well and she plans to be back on court early in the season.\n\nOpals point guard Kathleen MacLeod also pulled out after falling pregnant, but the Capitals compensated by signing former WNBA All-Star Renee Montgomery last week.\n\nMontgomery's Minnesota Lynx has qualified for the WNBA Finals after disposing of Phoenix in the western conference finals.\n\nIt means Montgomery will miss at least the season-opener against Dandenong at AIS Arena on October 10, and the week two games at Sydney and Townsville should the WNBA Finals go the full five games.\n\nA lack of personnel, particularly in the front court, has forced the Capitals to cancel its pre-season game in Sydney on Saturday.\n\nWith Jackson, Bishop and Montgomery still absent, just seven contracted players suited up in three games against South-East Queensland last weekend.\n\nHanna Zavecz injured her ribs at training last week and Opals youngster Steph Talbot hit her head on the court against the Stars.\n\nThe Capitals aren't willing to risk the pair this week before the start of the WNBL season, but both will be fit to play.\n\nMeanwhile, the Capitals are yet to finalise a deal which would see the majority of their home games shifted from AIS Arena to the Royal Theatre.\n\nHowever, it is understood the club is confident an agreement will be reached before season tip-off.\n\nIt is hoped the move into the city to a smaller venue will ensure bigger crowds and a better atmosphere as the Capitals shoot for a first finals appearance since 2010-11.

In the film, which takes place in the 2030s, astronauts regularly travel to Mars and live on the surface to explore. \"The Martian\" is set to open October 2. \n\n\"Sending people to Mars and returning them safely is the challenge of a generation,\" Damon says in the NASA video. \"Journey to Mars will forever change our history books, rewriting what we know about the red planet and expanding the human presence deeper into the solar system.\" \n\nFor better or worse, it often takes a little Hollywood magic to capture the public's attention, especially when it comes to science. So, how does a mission to Mars play out? \n\nJourney to Mars begins on International Space Station \n\nRight now, some 250 miles above land on the International Space Station, American astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko are studying the effect of long periods without gravity on the human body. The \"One Year Mission\" on the space station will help prepare for future journeys. Kelly led a Twitter chat Saturday, six months into his mission, sharing insights into what they've learned so far. \n\nNo drop of sweat, coffee or urine goes to waste on the station thanks to the Environmental Control and Life Support System. The system recovers and recycles water from various sources so it can be reclaimed and filtered for consumption through the Water Recovery System. \n\nThe International Space Station uses a deployable fresh-food production system known as Veggie to build a continuous source of food. Using red, blue, and green lights, Veggie helps plants grow in pillows, small bags with a wicking surface containing media and fertilizer, to be harvested by astronauts. Astronauts used the system to grow red romaine lettuce in 2014 -- a huge step in space farming. \n\nGetting there \n\nFuture trips to Mars could take 500 days or longer so it better be a smooth ride. The vehicle that will bring crews to space is the Orion spacecraft, which will provide emergency abort capability, sustain the crew during the space travel and bring them back safely. Orion will launch on NASA's new heavy-left rocket, the Space Launch System \n\nStaying there \n\nAlthough \"The Martian\" takes place 20 years in the future, NASA is already working on many of the technologies that appear in the film. \n\nDamon's character, astronaut Mark Watney, spends time in the habitation module known as \"the Hab.\" Future astronauts who land on Mars will need such a home to survive. At Johnson Space Center in Houston, crews train for long-duration deep-space missions in the Human Exploration Research Analog known as HERA, a self-contained environment that simulates a deep-space habit. \n\nThe two-story habitat contains living quarters, workspaces, a hygiene module and a simulated airlock. Crews stay in the habitat for 14 days at a time conducting operational tasks, completing payload objectives and learning how to live together in an isolated environment. \n\nIn the film, Watney fends for himself with limited supplies after his crew leaves him behind, believing him dead. To pass time, he goes for a spin on his rover, which is based on NASA's Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle. The vehicle has been used in NASA's analog mission projects to troubleshoot and develop capabilities to support missions to an asteroid, Mars, its moons and elsewhere. It's built to handle address issues such as range, rapid entry and exit and radiation protection. Some versions of the vehicle have six pivoting wheels for maneuverability. In the instance of a flat tire, the vehicle simply lifts up the bad wheel and keeps on rolling. \n\nWatney spends most of his sol (Martian day) in a spacesuit to protect himself from the cold atmosphere, lack of breathable air and dust. \n\nNASA is working on two new prototypes to identify technology gaps between current spacesuits and ones sufficient for setting foot on Mars. Through the Z-2 and Prototype eXploration spacesuits, spacesuit engineers are examining the tradeoff between hard composite materials and fabrics to strike a balance between durability and flexibility.","title":"What you can learn from Matt Damon about Mars","media-type":"News","source":"Channel4000","published":"2015-09-19T19:04:08Z"}

Anyone who has seen him kick a ball knows that, especially those who saw his 2003 World Cup-winning drop goal in extra time in the final between Australia and England. Jonny Wilkinson has a sharp eye. Anyone who has seen him kick a ball knows that, especially those who saw his 2003 World Cup-winning drop goal in extra time in the final between Australia and England. Wilkinson doesn't raise the subject of that kick in an interview with Fairfax Media, but when asked he still fondly recalls the moment that is etched in rugby folklore.\n\n\"As soon as I dropped it I knew I wasn't going to smash it out the back of the stadium, but I knew it was going to go straight. It was exactly what I was asking for,\" he says with the softest of laughs.\n\nFast forward to today. Even in retirement, Wilkinson, 36, still has that sharp eye. Okay \u2026 he no longer needs to use it for sizing up kicks, or reading a game from his old playmaking position at No.10.\n\nHowever, Wilkinson, who retired from Test rugby in December 2012 - with 97 Test caps for England and the British and Irish Lions - and all professional rugby in May last year, has a sharp eye for talent.\n\nWhen asked about two World Cup players of contrasting size, experience and - arguably \u2013 rugby ability, who could be much spoken of by the time the World Cup ends on November 1, Wilkinson says ...\n\nWallabies veteran Matt Giteau, 32, 85kg, 178cm and the sole survivor in this Wallabies squad of that losing 2003 side with 96 Tests caps since his 2002 Test debut. and England rookie Sam Burgess, 26, 116kg, 196cm, with two Test caps and a World Cup debutant a little less than one year since leaving the 2014 NRL premiership winning Rabbitohs.\n\nPending selections, both centres could square off in their crucial Pool A game at Twickenham on October 4 (6am AEST); or even in the final if both teams qualify.\n\nWilkinson's esteem for Giteau was clear in May last year when he said: \"I don't quite know how a team ever let him go in Australia\" after Giteau missed World Cup selection in 2011 and joined Toulon.\n\nWilkinson believes the Wallabies' fate will largely hinge on Giteau, who returned to the team after the Australian Rugby Union changed its selection policy on overseas-based players. The previously closed door is now open to those with 60 Tests and seven non-consecutive years in an Australian Super Rugby team.\n\nAsked if Giteau's most valuable asset is his ability or experience, Wilkinson says: \"The fact he has been able to accumulate all that experience - all that decision-making ability, all that composure, all that wealth of knowledge and rugby wisdom - is huge.\n\n\"But what's amazing is that he is still plays with a kind of youthful exuberance that allows him to still be a game breaker at any point.\n\n\"That combination makes him dangerous. He is still one of the guys who can make the 50 or 60-yard break.\n\n\"He is still the guy that is creating things. But he is still the guy sitting back saying, 'Now is the time to do this', and directing the team. He could be the one who could turn a game from losing to winning in an instant.\"\n\nWilkinson believes players like Giteau are crucial to any World Cup team.\n\n\"The game is largely at the feet of these kind of players,\" Wilkinson says.\n\n\"It is amazing how dominant and the effect the guy has had on the Top 14.\n\n\"And the Top 14 in France is not a competition - in the way it is played - that should allow itself to be defined by someone playing in the centre role. But he has done it.\n\n\"When you leave space or offer options and you give him a platform to play with, give him some decent ball when he wants it, it is like a red rag to a bull after that.\n\n\"That is exactly what he did and that is exactly what he will do for Australia.\"\n\nDespite voices to the contrary, Wilkinson steadfastly believes Burgess should be in England's World Cup squad just one year into his code switch. \"He is an enormous talent,\" Wilkinson says.\n\nWilkinson says Burgess' \"leadership\" traits are a \"top priority in terms of being a team guy\".\n\nHe also cites as \"inspirational\" qualities, \"his strength in defence and attack\", adding that with \"what he brings to a team with his aura you have a very special player\".\n\nHowever, Wilkinson recognises Burgess is far from the finished product.\n\n\"There are certain elements that are just rugby \u2013 you can take off union or league, it's just rugby,\" Wilkinson says.\n\n\"He has all that, the rugby part. The union part is just positional. There are the subtle nuances and largely to a degree it goes beyond that to managing the game and everyone has to do that nowadays.\"\n\nWilkinson believes picking Burgess or not should come down to balancing his strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\"You have got to weigh up, 'How much are we willing to take, knowing that maybe there may have been another season in there to build [his game] up',\" Wilkinson says.\n\n\"But then you look at the weight of the balance on the other side and say, 'This guy is just too strong. His presence is too formidable in terms of how it affects other guys'.\n\n\"And you say, 'Actually that is going to be the most beneficial thing', in terms of how you might want to use him.\n\n\"And if they are using him off the bench, they can control that game management side because they will be able to send messages on with him.\"\n\nWilkinson hopes Burgess enjoys a long future in English rugby, saying: \"He is a once in a generation kind of player in what he brings with that personal strength.\n\n\"I am a big fan of his and a lot of the other guys coming across [from league].\n\n\"This game of ours is won just like any other game: it takes a lot of time to learn it.\n\n\"That goes for us who've played it all our lives, not just guys who are coming over.\"\n\nJonny Wilkinson is a Land Rover ambassador.

An estimated 6,000 baby boomer women in the U.S. reach menopause every day and suffer both physical and emotional symptoms that can linger and interfere with their relationships and marriages.  Hesitant to share her new emotions with her husband, divorce sometimes ensues. \n \n\u201cMen often wonder why she rejects him in the bedroom, why she doesn\u2019t want to go out as much, and why she seems colder, more anxious and feels old, unattractive, overweight, tired,  overwhelmed and confused or depressed,\u201d says  Mary Jo Rapini, a licensed psychotherapist and co-author of newly published, Re-Coupling: A Couple\u2019s 4-step Guide to Greater Intimacy and Better Sex. \u201cWhile menopause affects women physically, it\u2019s not the lack of sex, night sweats or fatigue that leave men feeling unloved.

Hormone therapy helps, but it isn\u2019t a magic cure, and many women cannot use it. \r \n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If sex is being avoided, it doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love you anymore.

And in 2012, Hurricane Sandy damaged power plants and equipment, shutting the power to millions of residents for days. \n \nThese events - and the certainty of more in the future - have given the state plenty of reasons to look for new ways to prevent power loss in emergencies. \n \nIn the search for solutions, though, a major problem keeps popping up. The standard model for a region\u2019s electric grid is built around one or a few large plants producing electricity and shipping it often long distances on transmission lines to customers. \n \nIf the plant or the line goes down, so does the grid. For authorities trying to overcome this structural issue, one idea is getting a serious look. \n \nIt\u2019s called a microgrid , and officials from Potsdam to Brooklyn are betting that the concept will keep the lights on the next time an unwelcome visitor threatens the flow of electricity to hospitals and other vital facilities. \n \n\u201cMuch of New York\u2019s effort is predicated on resiliency,\u201d says Lavelle Freeman, the manager of distribution, planning and engineering for GE\u2019s Energy Consulting business. \u201cSandy is just the most recent example that has people asking: what you do to prevent the grid from collapsing for an extended period of time?\u201d \n \nAt its heart, a microgrid is a standalone power system embedded within a region\u2019s grid that can operate independently when a power outage starts. During a disruption, a microgrid acts as a powered island that keeps critical infrastructure like fire and gas stations, clinics and telecommunications systems running.","title":"Electric Microgrids Could Shore Up Cities for Future Disasters","media-type":"News","source":"Product Design and Development","published":"2015-09-16T17:13:43Z"}

{"id":"cdeb22c4-1d29-4cec-8b83-a5fa0436a65c","content":"NEW YORK , Sept. 17, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ -- The Credit Suisse Research Institute today released a report entitled \"Fat: The New Health Paradigm\" which explores the influence of medical recommendations on fat consumption globally, the recent change in consumer perceptions of fat, and what impact this shift has for investors. \n  \nWhile historically medical recommendations encouraged dramatically reducing consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol and placed no limits on polyunsaturated fats and carbohydrate intake, consumer buying patterns and medical research are now moving gradually away from these recommendations to favor food products with more natural unprocessed fats and rich in saturated and monounsaturated fats (organic dairy, grass-fed meats, natural oils, and nuts). The report illustrates this evolution by evaluating over 400 medical research papers and books written by academics and industry experts, and at the same time reveals the results of two proprietary surveys of doctors, nutritionists, and consumers. \n \n\"We found that 40% of nutritionists and 70% of general practitioners surveyed believe that eating cholesterol-rich foods has damaging cardiovascular effects. This is not true, according to the extensive research that has become available in recent years. Furthermore, they have limited knowledge of the potential benefits and risks of increased fat consumption,\" said Giles Keating, Vice Chairman of Investment Strategy & Research and Deputy Global Chief Investment Officer for Private Banking & Wealth Management. \"There is a concerning knowledge gap between the facts on fat and what consumers have been told.\" \n \nIn spite of this, consumer purchasing habits reveal that consumers are making new choices, which presents powerful investment ideas: global consumption of butter is growing globally at a rate of 2-4% annually; whole milk sales are up 11% while skim milk sales are down 14% in the US in the last six months; and organic egg consumption in the US is up 21% in the last 12 months. The report shows that fat consumption will continue to grow over the next fifteen years with fat accounting for 31% of calorie intake by 2030, up from 26% currently. Saturated fat should account for 13% of all calorie intake by 2030, from just above 9% now. \n \n\"We believe that consumers are at a turning point and this has distinct implications for investors. The report's conclusion is simple \u2013 natural unprocessed fats are healthy and are integral to transforming our society into one that focuses on developing and maintaining healthy individuals,\" said Stefano Natella, Global Head of Equity Research and an author of the study. \n \nAdditional forecasts for macronutrient and fat-containing food consumption levels by 2030 include: \n \nGLOBAL \n Fat consumption per capita is likely to soar by 23%, protein by 12%, and carbs will likely decline by 2%. Total demand for fat will be much higher\u2014up 43% or 1.9% a year\u2014given the 16% growth in the global population expected over the next fifteen years.  Within fat: Saturated fat is likely to grow from 9.4% in 2011 to 12.7% of daily energy intake and monounsaturated from 10.2% to 12.2%.  Polyunsaturated omega-6 is expected to decline slightly from 6% to 5.4% and omega-3 will grow from 0.50% to 0.55% (excluding supplements).   Carbohydrates will decline from 60% of global energy intake in 2011 to 55% by 2030. The rising awareness of the link between excess carbohydrate consumption and metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular issues will largely contribute to this decrease.  Red meat consumption is expected to grow 23% over the next fifteen years.  Egg consumption is expected to grow at a rate of 4% a year, as the cholesterol-heart link gradually disappears from people's minds. By 2030, the world could consume close to 300 eggs a year per capita (just over five eggs a week).  \nREGIONAL \n The US :  Meat consumption is forecasted to trend higher with red meat in the lead.  Egg consumption should be 350 per year (almost one a day) up from 235 currently.  Among solvent-extracted oils, a small decline is expected, with soybean oil still as the best-selling, including the new high-oleic versions.  Butter should grow faster as the market learns the benefits of eating butter and as negative perceptions linked to saturated fats gradually disappears.   Europe :  Red meat consumption per capita is expected to grow 9% and poultry 19%.  Fish consumption should grow slower at 12%, as consumption is already at a relative high level and availability is more constrained.  Milk, cheese and yogurt should expand 11% or 0.7% a year, but butter consumption should grow 4% a year. The 5.5 kg per capita expected for 2030 is almost 10% below consumption in 1990.  Egg consumption should increase sharply and expand by 42% or over 2% a year to 300 eggs a year per person.  Vegetable oil consumption on a per capita basis should remain basically flat.  Solvent-extracted oils should decline 10%, while natural oils (olive, palm, and coconut) should grow more than 30%, albeit from a small base.   \nFor a copy of the report, please click here: Credit Suisse Research Institute: Fat: The New Health Paradigm . \n \nCredit Suisse AG\u00a0 \nCredit Suisse AG is one of the world's leading financial services providers and is part of the Credit Suisse group of companies (referred to here as 'Credit Suisse').

It surpassed the record of $20.9 million set by Tiger Woods in 2007. \n \n\"For me it's important to give it back to not only the people that need it, but also to our team who made it possible,\" the 22-year-old told CNN. \n\n\"This is a bonus that isn't just for me, I promise you that. \n\n\"This is going to a lot of various places because this season was magical and there was a lot of behind the scenes work done by a lot of people, and I want to be able to share that with them.\" \n\nWith Australian Jason Day failing to finish in the top five on Sunday, Spieth took the PGA Championship winner's place at the top of the rankings. \n\nThe Texan was able to celebrate his incredible weekend of success with his whole family and says it was made all the more special by the presence of his autistic sister Ellie, who missed out on his previous wins. \n\n\"It was really cool, it was great. When she came out I didn't even see her,\" he said. \n\n\"I wasn't expecting it, she just kind of ran into me and gave me a hug. It was awesome. \n\n\"It was special to have everybody here, it was just like the Masters except that Ellie was added in too. \n\n\"I owe everything to my family. They're my inspiration, they're the ones who put in the sacrifice to allow me to be here so I'm able to now celebrate with them and it's going to be fun.\" \n\nSpieth's season started with victories in the opening two majors -- the U.S. Open and the Masters -- and he fell just short of becoming the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the opening three when he missed out on a playoff at the British Open by one shot. \n\nHe then tied for second at the PGA Championship, but missed the cut in the opening two FedEx Cup playoff events before bouncing back when it most mattered at East Lake. \n\nThe Atlanta venue was the home course of golf legend Bobby Jones, the only man to win a calendar grand slam -- in 1930, when two of the majors were amateur championships. \n\n\"It's amazing. It's almost like a major championship,\" Spieth said of the elite 30-player event. \n\n\"What an unbelievable venue this is, the scene of a lot of Bobby Jones' history. \n\n\"It's cool to come back here and attack this golf course and play it the right way. I didn't make it easy on myself but all in all that last walk up 18 was pretty fun.\"","title":"Jordan Spieth: Golfer sets prize money record","media-type":"News","source":"Click2Houston.com","published":"2015-09-28T15:31:41Z"}

I now knew, for certain, that I was right; all of my symptoms were tied to just one disease. However, my joy was short-lived. Seconds later, I was told that the autoimmune disease battering my body, igG4 related systemic disease, had no cure.  As a single woman, I wondered, who would care for me if I could not. \n \nAt that time, I lived alone in a townhouse, in a city where I knew no one other than my next door neighbor.  My home had stairs, slot of them, which often, pain would not allow me to climb. I worked full-time to maintain health insurance and prescription coverage. My job also allowed me to try meeting the debilitating obligations of my never-ending medical bills because there was no one else providing me with financial support. \n \nMy rheumatologist ordered blood tests, CT scans, x-rays and MRI\u2019s to confirm her diagnosis and then came a new round of drugs, aimed at controlling the inflammation that damaged organs in my body.  The \u201cwhat ifs\u201d flooded in and gave me a headache over the next few months as.  What if I can\u2019t work anymore? How will I survive? Will I have to sell my home?  How will I pay for in house care or a nursing home?  If I can stay in my townhome, is it safe? What if I fall ill in the house alone? Who will be able to get in to get me help? \n \nI thought I was prepared for anything when I bought more life insurance and had my will, healthy proxy, living will and power of attorney updated.  But, that only took care of my financial matters, my funeral and medical wishes but not my everyday needs. I\u2019d neglected to buy long term disability insurance when I was well. By the time I finally applied my pre-existing condition prevented from getting it. \n \nI thought about rebuilding my savings so I could pay for private care on my own if I couldn\u2019t work. However, trying to avoid being sued over doctor\u2019s bills or being forced to file for bankruptcy made it impossible for me to accumulate any real wealth. \n \nI knew I didn\u2019t want my parents to shoulder all the burden of caring for me nor did I want to move into their house.  So, I was motivated to get creative to solve the question: Who will care for me? I jotted down a list of relatives and close friends who I could call upon, in a rotation, to avoid stressing any one person out or abusing their generosity.  I looked for services that I could afford that could help me maintain my independence: carpet cleaners, maid services, grocery stores that let you shop from home and have your groceries delivered, and handyman services. I put handheld shower heads in all the bathrooms so I could sit down and wash myself. I also got a car that had seats that folded down for the times I could walk on my own and required a walker or wheelchair. I switched most of my bills from paper to electronic so they could be paid online. \n \nBy far, the hardest thing I had to learn to do was ask for help and learn to take it when it\u2019s offered. I had to change my attitude by not seeing myself as helpless just because I need some help; that made a world of difference. I began letting other people know when my doctor\u2019s appointments and procedures were scheduled so they knew when I might need to be picked up or require assistance. Before I knew it is assemble an army, that\u2019s ready, willing and able to care for me at those times I can\u2019t care for myself. \n \nnikabeamon.com","title":"Sick and Single, Who Will Care for Me?","media-type":"News","source":"HealthMediciNet.com","published":"2015-09-23T16:40:06Z"}

Mattox bannished Genora Hamm Biggs, a member of 92 years, for saying she wasn't happy with his services\u00a0 Rev. Mattox was sent a letter asking him to collect his things He then took out a restraining againt Biggs' grandson and another member \u00a0 Hamm Biggs used to be a church officer, and her father was a founder  \nMembers of a northeast Georgia church have voted to fire a pastor who controversially banned a 103-year-old from the congregation after she disagreed with his services. \n\nThe votes were cast Sunday against Reverend Tim Mattox, who have since issues him a 'Letter of Termination' asking him to remove his belongings from the\u00a0Union Grove Baptist Church of Elberton. \n\nRev. Mattox hit headlines last Friday after it was revealed he had banished Genora Hamm Biggs - a church member of 92 years - for displaying conduct that was 'detrimental' to others after she spoke out about his practices, including laying hands on members. \n\nAccording to The Atlanta Journal\u2011Constitution , Rev. Mattox has now taken a restraining order out against the grandson of Hamm Biggs, as well as a former church secretary.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n   \nGenora Hamm Biggs, known as the 'mother of the church', has been going to Union Grove Baptist Church in Elberton since she joined it 92 years ago, but was banished last week for disagreeing with the pastor \n\nThe outspoken Hamm Biggs, a retired teacher, said at the weekend that the practices used by Rev. Mattox were not Baptist. \n\n'He is a holy sanctified minister or so he says. We voted him in and we didn't know it until he was there. We are Baptists and that's what we want to stay,' Biggs said. \n\nA statement from the Union Grove church to the Athens Banner-Herald said fellow members decided to expel Hamm Biggs. \n\n'It was determined by the congregation during a church conference meeting, which Mrs. Biggs was present at the time of the meeting, that the behavior of Mrs. Biggs and others was detrimental to the church at large and could no longer be allowed,' according to the statement. \n\nChurch members voted in August to revoke Hamm Biggs' membership, although she has continued attending services. \n \nHamm Biggs was previously a church officer, and her father was one of its founders. She received a letter about her expulsion. \n\n'I was unhappy and shocked,' said Biggs. 'I joined the church when I was 11 years old.' \n\nAlso banned from the church was Hamm Biggs' grandson, Eliott Dye, a member for 30 years, and Kevin Hamm, an ordained minister who was also a member of the church. \n\nHamm said: 'I tried to talk with [Mattox] and he was just determined to say, 'You can't come over here, period.' \n\nHamm Biggs said despite the ban, she still considers herself a member of the congregation. She attended the Sunday service last weekend.\u00a0 \n   \nHamm Biggs was left heartbroken after she received a letter in the mail from church members who banned her from stepping foot inside the church \n \nHamm Biggs explained: 'He told police he wanted to put us out, but the police told him 'you can't do that' \n\nHamm Biggs said the entire debacle unfolded after she told the Reverend Mattox she did not agree with his preaching style.\u00a0 \n\nBut her complaints did not sit well with him. \n\nSoon after she voiced her opinion, the letter arrived. In the letter, sent by certified mail, Hamm Biggs learnt that her church-going privileges were being 'revoked.'\u00a0 \n\nIt stated:\u00a0'Dear Mrs. Genora Hamm Biggs, This letter is to inform you that according to the by-laws of the Union Grove Baptist Church, and by vote of the active members, any membership or associations that you have had with this church are now officially revoked.\u00a0 \n\n'Therefore, you cannot attend Union Grove Baptist Church for any reason whatsoever. You are not to come to the property of the Union Grove Baptist Church located at 680 Pulliam Street, Elberton, Georgia 30635.\u00a0 \n\nSincerely, The members and officers of the Union Grove Baptist Church.'\u00a0 \n\n\nThe devout Christian was a former city clerk and a school teacher who taught first grade for 40 years.\u00a0 \n\nShe says she prays daily but is having her faith tested  after she received the letter.\u00a0 \n\nAnd it got worse when she defied the church's orders and went back to worship. She said she was met by the frosty priest who wanted police to escort her out.\u00a0 \n\nHamm Biggs said: 'The letter said we're not to come back, but we went back \u2013 police were there.'\u00a0 \n\nShe told Fox Carolina : 'He told police he wanted to put us out, but the police told him 'you can't do that.' \n\nAfter that,  the pastor dismissed the service. The lights were turned off and Hamm Biggs was left sitting on the pew of a darkened sanctuary. \n\n'I was shocked. It was not a good feeling. I haven't seen anything like this before,' she said shaking her head. \n   \nIn the letter, sent by certified mail, it was signed by members and officers of the Union Grove Baptist Church' \n   \nHamm Biggs' name is etched on the side of the church, but she's been scarred by the entire bad experience \n\nElberton police officers say it is a civil matter and have not made any arrests.\u00a0 \n\nHamm  Biggs' grandson, Eliott Dye and Kevin Hamm say they are upset over the way Hamm Biggs was treated. \n\nHamm told Online Athens : 'To disrespect a pillar and a mother of the church; how can we sit back and watch something like this go forward?' \n\nHer grandson describes his granny as 'outspoken'. He recalls an incident when  a  woman in the church called his grandmother 'Jezebel,' but she didn't hear what she'd said. \n\nHe said: 'I never told her because her feelings would have been hurt. They have been so rude and I don't understand why it's been directed at my grandmother...[But] my grandmother can be pretty outspoken and that could have a lot to do with it.' \n\nThe embattled centenarian, has, however, received the backing of quite a few of the church's 150 parishioners. \n\nEzell Land, who used to be a deacon at the church, said the Hamm Biggs' family literally founded the church.\u00a0He said quite simply: 'It's not right!' \n\n'They brought it here on a mule and a wagon from the country when I was a little boy,' Land said.\u00a0 \n\nLand also attended the church for 56 years before he decided to leave after a run-in with the pastor over his singing. \n\n'Every time I would get up, the pastor would get up and make remarks when I sang and stuff. So, I just got my hat and I left,' he said.\u00a0 \n   \nEzell Land, who used to be a deacon at the church, said the Hamm Biggs' family literally founded the church. He said quite simply: 'It's not right!' \n\nHamm Biggs' name is etched on the side of the church, but she says she's been scarred by the entire experience.\u00a0 \n\nShe never expected to be thrown out of a church she loved. \n\n'I wanna get my church straight like it has been,' she said sadly.\u00a0 \n\nHamm Biggs is receiving widespread support from people on social media. Many have taken to the church's Facebook page to voice their disgust at the church's actions. \n\nShataphy Baugns wrote: 'This is a disgrace to all the children of God....The devil is what you serve @ this church bless the elder lady soul. I pray God keep her covered and give her strength from the hurt she felt with this ridiculous decision made by this pastor.' \n\nScott Allen wrote: 'I have never heard of such an act in all my life. It's bad enough that non believer are attacking us believers, but to hear of this kind of action is shame.\u00a0 \n\n'Those who signed that mean letter should apologize and allow Miss Hamm Biggs back into the church. Make things right again. This is not your house, it is God's House.'","title":"Baptist church members vote to FIRE pastor who kicked out a 103-year-old member after she disagreed with his services","media-type":"News","source":"Mail Online UK","published":"2015-09-25T06:09:59Z"}

Examiner.com had the chance to chat with the actress about what's coming up for Percy, \"NCIS: New Orleans\" season2, her dream \"NCIS\" crossover and more. \n\nExaminer.com: What do you like most about playing Percy in season 2 as a member of the team versus just working with the team like in season 1? \n \nShalita Grant: \"The relationships are a lot more specific. Also, there's a lot of probie jokes and ribbing, so she sort of comes in \u2013 even though she's ATF \u2013 she's not really in the position of the know-it-all whatever. LaSalle and Brody they give her a rough time, and she's all game for it. Also, the stunts are bigger because I have more show now so we have a lot more stunts and they're explosive and crazy and I get to do a lot of really cool stuff. It's a good time.\" \n \nSpeaking of Percy as the probie, or NFG as they're calling her, how long is that going to last? Any more pranks like with her badge coming up? \n \nYeah, there is. She's not new for only one episode. It's also Sonja too getting used to being on a team and having a boss. Pride and her relationship is getting more specific and she's getting used to having someone to report to, which she didn't really have before because she was doing these solo undercover missions and so she didn't have someone that she had to run things by every day. It was more of a check-in thing. And now she has a real boss, so she has to get used to that too. So everybody's getting used to everybody on the show, and LaSalle and Brody take full advantage of it for as long as they can. \n \nHow long is the adjustment period going to be for Percy? \n \nIt's long. The one that we're on now \u2013 we're on episode 8 \u2013 she's still having a tough time. Also her backstory, her past is coming up as well. Percy's very private, and so the fact that she is working on a team of people who feel like a family, she really has to get used to that. So a lot of the stuff from her past comes up, and she would prefer to deal with it her own way, which eventually becomes a problem. We'll see that work out too. It's an adjustment period. \n \nYou mentioned that her backstory is coming up. Is there an episode number for that or is it over multiple episodes? \n \nThere are a few episodes that her backstory kind of comes up. But we're going to see tomorrow night some of that. We're going to get introduced to some of what Percy has in her backyard, but definitely episode 4 and episode 6 are pretty heavy. You get a lot more information about Percy. \n \nWhat can you tease about tomorrow's episode and case? \n \nWell, I watched the preview and they didn't show what the crime is, but there is a Navy superstar who dies and we have to find out if this was a terrorist group, if this was an inside job and I think for Percy and also for LaSalle, it kind of hits home a little bit for them, so we'll get to see some Percy and LaSalle action, fighting some bad guys. \n \nSo is Percy going to be partnered up with LaSalle mostly? \n \nWe do kind of toss around a bit, but this episode is a lot of Percy and LaSalle. \n \nPercy worked undercover at ATF. Will we see that now that she's with NCIS, or is that not in the cards as she adjusts? \n \nOh yeah, that definitely comes up. In the first episode, when Percy's old ATF boss came on, so there is definitely, Percy's relying on her prior work with that agency, and that definitely shows up in the season. \u2026You might [see her undercover soon]. \n \nAt the end of the premiere, Percy tells Pride that there's a bounty out on him. Can you tease anything about what's coming up with that or how often it will be brought up? \n \nWhat I can say is that from where I'm standing, I believe that Zed is a much crazier adversary than Baitfish. His network, the separatist militia, they hold a grudge, and it's worth watching. It's worth watching how they work out trying to get my boss. \n \nDoes Percy think that this is a bigger deal than Pride does? \n \nI think what we saw at the end of the first episode \u2013 I think that Pride is a seasoned officer, right? So he knows that if someone puts a bounty out on a cop, that that's a pretty big deal and it's no small potatoes, like $2000. It's a $50,000 bounty. So, I think Pride knows that this is definitely a problem, but at the end of that scene, he just really wanted to celebrate opening up the bar. But Percy, being a younger agent, [to her] there's an immediacy there that Pride just doesn't have because he's been on the job for so long. So it does come up again and we will see Zed become a bigger problem and we'll see how Pride deals with it. \n \nCBS put up a sneak peek (above) of Percy having to clean the bar in the next episode. How often are we going to see them at the bar? Every episode? Every few episodes? \n \nI think you see the bar almost every episode. You get to see how he's coming along with it, the progress of getting the bar off the ground. But I'm excited about the bar. There's so many possibilities with Pride's bar, it's kind of crazy. \n \nThat's where we'll bring in music too more, right? \n \nYeah. I'm excited to see what the writers have for that space. So far, we're really just setting it up, just getting it off its feet. \n \nCan you tease any fun upcoming episodes? \n \nEpisode 2 is really good and it's really touching, and I think for LaSalle too, we get to see a little bit more about what happened with the mermaid and we're going to talk a little bit about that too, so it's a good episode. I watched it when I was doing ADR, and I was really touched and excited too because the stunts, all the action that we have is really cool. What I can speak to is that the first six episodes have felt like an action movie. The crew, everybody, we're doing so much more in these episodes. It's crazy. I can't wait for you to see episode 6. That's crazy. It feels like an action film. It really does. \n \nThe first season of the show had a few crossovers.

The area is currently a restricted zone off-limits to civilians, but the group's travel agency had secured the necessary permit.\n\n\"It's customary to grant permits for tourist visits\" to the site, Mexico's Foreign Affairs Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu said at a press conference Monday.\n\nThe strike has also raised questions on targeting the convoy from the air as the passengers had reportedly stopped for a picnic-style meal.\n\nRuiz Massieu flew to Cairo late Monday, accompanied by families of the victims, personnel from the Health Ministry and police forensics experts, local daily La Jornada reported.\n\nSo far, only one of the fatal victims has been identified: Rafael Bejarano Rangel, a musician whose mother Marisela Rangel Davalos, one of the hospitalized, organized the visit to Egypt.\n\nRangel Davalos' sister, Araceli Rangel Davalos, has said similar trips to Egypt had been organized many times before, with the same guide and travel agency, and that there had never been a problem.\n\nFour Egyptians, including guides and drivers, were also killed, and another two wounded, according to a spokesman for Egypt's Interior Ministry, Ayman Helmi.\n\nMexico's government Monday demanded Egypt launch a \"swift and in-depth\" investigation into the accidental strike.\n\nEygpt's embassy in Mexico said the government will establish an \"investigative committee headed by the prime minister himself to resolve the case and publish the results,\" according to Mexico's ministry.

The state\u2019s apple crop is mostly grown in four regions around Cleveland, Haywood, Henderson and Wilkes counties, according to the N.C. Department of Agriculture. \n      \nGrowing up in Asheville, I have fond memories of apple picking in Henderson County, the largest apple-producing county in the state. \n \nEach fall, my family took the short drive to Stepp\u2019s Hillcrest Orchard, a fourth generation working farm just northeast of Hendersonville. The Stepp family has been inviting guests to pick their own apples for 45 years at its \u201cU-Pick Apple Orchard.\u201d \n \nA not-so-fond memory from my childhood involves the crabapple, the only native North American apple variety. A large crabapple tree in our backyard frequently shed the small, sour fruit across our yard. Perhaps the most dreaded of our chores, my brother and I were responsible for picking up the often-rotten crabapples scattered in the grass before my parents mowed the lawn or hosted a backyard party. \n \nThere are plenty of apple orchards to visit in Wilkes County this fall. To see a list, visit www.visitwilkesboronc.com\/explore\/attractions\/orchards . \n \nEven if you can\u2019t make it to an apple-picking orchard, there are plenty of other ways to savor fall\u2019s sweetest flavor in the coming weeks. \n \nJust around the corner, the Brushy Mountain Apple Festival will be Oct. 3 in downtown North Wilkesboro. From 8 a.m.-5 p.m., you can enjoy mountain heritage exhibits, music, crafts and food\u2014including, of course, a bounty of apple products. \n \nBelow are a few recipes (two sweet, one savory) that highlight the fruit. \n \nApple crumb pie \n \n2\/3 cup sugar \n \n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour \n \n3\/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon \n \n6-8 apples, pared, cored and sliced (6 cups) \n \n1 9-inch unbaked pastry shell \n \n1\/2 cup all-purpose flour \n \n1\/4 cup sugar \n \n1\/4 cup cold butter \n \nCombine first 3 ingredients; stir into apples. Turn apple mixture into pastry shell. Combine remaining flour and sugar, and cut in butter until crumbly. Sprinkle over apples. Bake at 400 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes or until done. If pie shell browns too quickly, cover the edge with foil. \n \nApple cheddar sage frittata \n \n8 eggs \n \n1 tablespoon milk or cream \n \n1 tablespoon butter \n \n2 shallots, thinly sliced \n \n4 ounces pancetta (or bacon) finely diced \n \n1\/4 teaspoon cinnamon \n \n1 red apple, cored and diced \n \n4 ounces cheddar cheese, in small cubes \n \n1 tablespoon sage, finely chopped, plus extra whole leaves for topping \n \nSalt and pepper to taste \n \nPreheat oven to 350 degrees \n \nIn a bowl, beat eggs with milk, salt and pepper. Set aside. \n \nHeat a cast iron skillet on medium heat. Melt butter and add shallots, cook for 2 minutes. Add pancetta and cook another 2 minutes. Add diced apple. Cover skillet and cook until apples begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add cinnamon and stir to combine. Spread shallot, apple and pancetta mixture evenly throughout skillet. Add egg mixture. Cover and cook without disturbing 6 minutes or until edges begin to set. Sprinkle with chopped sage and diced cheddar. \n \nTransfer skillet to oven and bake 7-9 minutes so the eggs can finish setting. Serve directly from skillet. Serves 6-8. \n \nItalian apple torta (torta di mele) \n \n1 cup butter \n \n4 golden delicious apples \n \n2 1\/4 cups flour \n \n1 tablespoon baking powder \n \n1\/2 teaspoon cinnamon \n \n1\/2 teaspoon salt \n \n4\u00a0 large eggs \n \n1 teaspoon vanilla extract \n \n1 cup sugar \n \n1 tablespoon amaretto liqueur \n \n1\/2 teaspoon lemon zest \n \n4 tablespoons butter, melted \n \n3 tablespoons sugar \n \nWhisk together flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon and set aside. \n \nIn a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat at medium speed for 3 minutes until mixture is pale yellow in color, creamy and thick. Turn speed down and gradually add flour mixture. Add lemon zest, vanilla and amaretto until blended; increase speed to medium for 2 more minutes. \n \nPeel, quarter, core and slice apples into 1\/2-inch-wide slices. Cut half of the apple slices into small chunks and fold them into batter. \n \nPour batter into a buttered and floured 9-inch springform pan. Arrange remaining apples slices, core side down, on top of the batter in circles over the entire surface with edges slightly overlapping. The apple arrangement should resemble a flower in full bloom. \n \nBrush apples and batter with melted butter and generously sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons sugar. \n \nPlace in center of oven and bake at 350 degrees for 70-90 minutes, until cake pulls away from sides of pan and the top of the cake is golden brown. \n \nRemove from oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then remove sides of the springform pan and cool cake completely. \n \nDust powdered sugar with cinnamon all over the cake.","title":"Cooking with N.C. apples","media-type":"News","source":"Wilkes Journal Patriot","published":"2015-09-18T18:22:11Z"}

{"id":"336bd374-3daa-4b80-b342-a28baed5d036","content":"(BPT) - With college football season upon us, there\u2019s no better way to enjoy time with family and friends than getting together to cheer on your favorite team. This year, with rising ticket, concession and travel costs, why not gather your friends and family together for a private \u201cstaygating\u201d party in your own living room? Here are five tips to hosting the ultimate staygate this fall to do game day right. \n  \n* Pick your game day early! Do you have a favorite rivalry game? Is there a certain Saturday that promises lots of good conference showdowns? Plan now and let your friends and family know you\u2019ll be hosting an all-day staygate so you can get a full house and an accurate headcount. Email invites make it easy to get an accurate headcount, especially if your staygating party is a larger affair. They are also more environmentally friendly, and best of all, free! \n \n* Impress your guests by watching the game on an amazing television \u2014 like the OLED 4K TV s from LG, which allow your fans to experience each moment with the best picture quality on the market. OLED technology delivers a breathtaking picture with perfect blacks and amazing color, even at wide viewing angles \u2014 so every seat in the house feels like the 50-yard line. \n \n* Create a stadium atmosphere to set the stage for game day. Easily set up a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-capable multi-room speaker system, like LG\u2019s Music Flow , to play a game day soundtrack featuring your team\u2019s fight song and popular in-game anthems to get your crowd pumped up before kickoff and keep them energized throughout the game. Just use your smartphone to stream your playlist from your favorite service via the Music Flow Player App to get the party started. By adding a Music Flow sound bar and surround system, it will enhance the viewing experience with enveloping game day sounds of bands and cheering crowds. \n \n* Serve a creative spread. Game day snacks can make or break the atmosphere of a staygate, so make certain your fans aren\u2019t calling foul on what you serve. Go online to order local favorites, from wings and pizza to sliders and nachos, to give your guests a taste of what it\u2019s like to be back on campus, or color-coordinate your spread to create a celebratory vibe. For inspiration, check out your favorite team sites or regional food blogs. \n \n* Stock up on game day essentials. Once your RSVP list is finalized, don\u2019t forget to stock up on festive game day favorites. Encourage your guests to dress for the occasion! Just because the team can\u2019t see you, doesn\u2019t mean your lucky socks are any less lucky. Break out those team colors, wear them with pride and challenge your fellow staygaters to do the same. Do you cheer on your team with shakers or foam fingers? Cowbells or clappers? Recreate that stadium electricity by offering your fans the same fun noisemakers at your staygate.\u00a0\u00a0 \n \nFor more tips and advice on how to \u201cdo game day right\u201d from Official NCAA Corporate Partner LG Electronics USA, visit www.lg.com\/us\/do-game-day-right . \u00a0","title":"Can't make it to the tailgate?

Nissan also temporarily suspended Kamla Nissan, its outlet in Worli. \n\nMalad-based businessman BU Trivedi, 55, who booked a Datsun Go Plus in May after making a downpayment is yet to receive delivery but is paying an EMI on the loan he was offered. \"In June I was told that the delivery was delayed. While Kamla Nissan has closed down for now, the car is yet to be delivered,\" Trivedi said. \n\nThe businessman, who has paid about Rs 20,000 as instalments, added that officials at Kamla Nissan told him that could not deliver the car since the company had blocked their code temporarily. \n\nArchitect Dinesh Patil had his new car delivered five months ago but cannot drive it on the streets as it is yet to be registered. \"My family has to be content watching it parked outside our house since the dealer did not register its number with the RTO,\" Patil said. \n\nThe Jogeshwari resident has sent copies of the debit note (issued by Torrent Nissan) reflecting the amount for registration of vehicle recoverable\/payable, insurance with Bharti AXA general, extended warranty recoverable\/payable and depot charges to Nisan Motors India hoping that something will come of it. \n\n\"I have received a reply saying they will get back to me. But I expected it to be prompt,\" Patil said adding that he would wait and watch. Trivedi has decided he will initiate legal action and has appointed a lawyer. \"After issuing them with a legal notice, I intend to move the consumer court for a solution,\" he said. \n\nWhile a Nissan India spokesperson sought time to respond, a company official informed that most cases had been sorted. \"Till we resolve issues of payment defaults and slowing down of sales with dealers, customers will have to use services of Ritu Nissan in Bhandup and Thane,\" the official said. \n\n\"There were problems with funding arising out of partnership issues. But that has been resolved and we shall be starting afresh from October 1,\" Anil Jagtiani, Kamla Nissan executive director, told Mirror. \"Kamla Nissan is opening a new showroom in the central suburbs, while Ritu Nissan would open a new outlet in Andheri,\" he added.","title":"Three of 4 Nissan outlets shut, car owners driven to despair","media-type":"News","source":"Mumbai Mirror","published":"2015-09-02T21:53:10Z"}

Belarusian Deputy Industry Minister Dmitry Korchik made the statement during the online conference hosted by the BelTA website on 24 September. \nThe official noted that during the latest session of the Belarusian-Indian intergovernmental commission the sides discussed the establishment of Belarusian industrial enterprises in India using the economic conditions the Indian side offers. Apart from that, an agreement to start assembling Belarusian tractors in India was signed. \u201cAs far as assembly enterprises are concerned, we are now looking into the matter together with Indian partners. It is necessary to decide on joint actions in October because there are certain peculiarities to take care of. As you know, India is an internationally recognized leader in tractor manufacturing. The country puts serious effort into developing the automobile engineering industry. We should find a joint niche, a joint product in order to get it made at assembly enterprises in India,\u201d explained the Belarusian Deputy Industry Minister. \n\nAt the same time shipments to third countries \u2014 Africa and Asia \u2014 where India already enjoys certain influence are under consideration. \u201cWe are talking about a new product in the countries where Belarus is not present for now while India has achieved certain success. We plan to reach those markets with a joint brand, a joint product in order to further develop our export geography. We cannot stay idle in this regard. It is necessary to act as fast as possible to agree business operation terms with the partners, to make up our minds on the products we are going to assemble together, and the technologies and conditions for setting up the joint ventures. The work has to be completed in H1 2016 at the latest,\u201d informed Dmitry Korchik. \n\nThe official also said he stays in touch with Indian partners of the Belarusian automobile manufacturing company BelAZ. There are plans to set up a service center by the end of the year. It will allow shipping more mining vehicles. \u201cThose are complicated vehicles. It would be very hard to sell them in this region without comprehensive aftersales service,\u201d explained the Deputy Industry Minister. \n\nThe official pointed out that just like China and Pakistan India represents a serious market for Belarus. Among other things Belarus intends to be part of the Make in India program. \u201cThe program is a major step on the part of the Indian government to attract investors, develop the manufacturing industry and other ones. India has created the program to get investments and create jobs. The country does not want to import merchandise. India wants to make it instead. It is a good offer for us,\u201d Dmitry Korchik was convinced. \n\nIn his words, the Make in India program provides for creating more attractive conditions \u2014 customs, taxation, transport, and manpower ones \u2014 for foreign companies. Belarusian companies such as MTZ, BelAZ, MAZ, and Gomselmash can take part in the program.","title":"Belarusian, Indian industrial companies to bring common brand to third-country markets","media-type":"News","source":"Belta","published":"2015-09-24T12:48:19Z"}

(Photo: Elisha Page \/ Argus Leader) \n\nWest Central (2-0) vs. Madison (2-0) \n\nWHEN\/WHERE: 7 p.m. Friday at Madison \n\nCOACHES: West Central \u2013 Kent Mueller (13th year with Trojans, 104-18); Madison \u2013 Max Hodgen (6th year with Bulldogs, 32-19) \n\nSEASON TO DATE: Through two games, the Bulldogs and Trojans have each played bully to Dakota Valley. West Central opened the season with a 44-7 victory over the Panthers, and Madison last week tallied a 49-14 win. Stiffer tests presented in their other games, but you\u2019d never know looking at the final scores. West Central flirted with a shutout against Canton, eventually winning 30-7. Madison got a heavy measure of revenge in walloping Dell Rapids \u2013 the team that beat them in the 11A championship last November \u2013 to the tune of 41-6. \n\nPOSTSEASON PRECURSOR: The No. 1 Bulldogs and No. 2 Trojans come in heavy 11A favorites, as Milbank Area (2-0), newcomer St. Thomas More (2-0) and a veteran team in Sioux Falls Christian (2-0) all vie for a spot at the table. Friday\u2019s matchup, then, could be a preview of what\u2019s to come in November. In Mitch Hansen, Madison has one of the state\u2019s best quarterbacks. The Bulldogs have an assortment of weapons with Brodie Frederiksen, who averaged over 7.9 yards a carry last season, and Mason Leighton, whose three catches last week all went for touchdowns. West Central is less likely to air it out, and will lean heavily on the ground attack of Jonah Rechtenbaugh, who has rushed for over 100 yards in each of their two wins. The Trojans also sport a veteran defense, with eight starters making their return, led by defensive linemen Hunter Hanley and Bryce Edberg. \n\nWHAT TO EXPECT: The two teams have a rich history as rivals, squaring off in the state finals as recently as 2013 when the Trojans won 28-21. Friday\u2019s early-season showdown isn\u2019t likely to trend the way of blowout. Madison might be best diversifying their attack, but it won\u2019t come easy against the Trojan defense. The Bulldogs are somewhat inexperienced on defense, by contrast, but have allowed just 20 points in two games. If home crowds count for anything then the slight edge goes to Madison, but this battle of top-ranked squads won\u2019t disappoint either way. \n\nRead or Share this story: http:\/\/argusne.ws\/1UKjLVY","title":"11A powers clash in Madison","media-type":"News","source":"Argus Leader","published":"2015-09-11T00:51:16Z"}

Jerry Mueck, Executive Vice President and husband of Robin, is also an owner. \n\n\"Our people are our greatest strength,\" says Mueck, \"and we now have in place a vibrant new management team -- led by an admired and proven leader, Chaille Ralph. Our leadership team has a shared vision to provide exciting new growth and innovation that will deliver even greater geographic reach, and inspired personal service to delight our clients.\" \n\n Heritage , which will celebrate its 40th Anniversary next year, has grown under Mueck's leadership from a few dozen agents in one office to 16 locations from the Gulf Coast to Central Texas, home to more than 300 licensed Realtors.

{"id":"db73aab4-839a-4750-a12b-b62945acf06f","content":"-Shipments in the second quarter of 2015 met previous guidance \n  \nBAODING, China , September 8, 2015 \/PRNewswire\/ -- Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited (\"Yingli Green Energy\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:YGE), one of the world's leading photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturers, known as \" Yingli Solar \" or \"Yingli\", today announced its unaudited consolidated financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and an expected non-cash impairment charge on long lived assets in the quarter ending September 30, 2015 . \n \nSecond Quarter 2015 Consolidated Financial and Operating Summary \n Total net revenues were RMB2,716.1 million ( US$438.1 million ).  Total photovoltaic (\"PV\") module shipments (including shipments for PV systems to the Company's own downstream PV projects[1]) were 727.9 MW.  Gross profit was RMB171.0 million ( US$27.6 million ), representing a gross margin of 6.3%. The gross margin on sales of PV modules was 7.9%.  Operating loss was RMB178.3 million ( US$28.8million ), representing a negative operating margin of 6.6%.  On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings before interest, tax expenses, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") were RMB198.8 million ( US$32.1 million ).  Net loss[2] was RMB598.1 million ( US$96.5 million ) and loss per ordinary share and per American depositary share (\"ADS\") was RMB3.29  (US$0.53) . On an adjusted non-GAAP[3] basis, net loss was RMB596.9 million ( US$96.3 million ) and loss per ordinary share and per ADS was RMB3.28  (US$0.53) .   \n[1] Revenues were not recognized for internal shipments as required by U.S. GAAP. \n \n[2] For convenience purposes, all references to \"net loss\/income\" in this press release, unless otherwise specified, represent \"net loss\/income attributable to Yingli Green Energy\" for all periods presented. \n \n[3] All non-GAAP measures other than EBITDA exclude, as applicable, share-based compensation, interest expenses related to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the amortization of the debt discount, the amortization of intangible assets, inventory provision, impairment of long-lived assets and non-cash provision for inventory purchase commitments. EBITDA excludes interest, tax expenses, depreciation and amortization. For further details on non-GAAP measures, please refer to the reconciliation table and a detailed discussion of the Company's use of non-GAAP information set forth elsewhere in this press release. \n  \n\"The Company achieved a PV module shipment volume of 727.9MW in the second quarter, which made our cumulative PV module deliveries exceed 14GW worldwide since our inception.\" commented Mr. Liansheng Miao , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Yingli Green Energy. \n \n\"During the second quarter of 2015, our shipments to China and the U.S. grew significantly and increased by 110% and 35%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2015. Due to our continuous efforts in market diversification, our shipments to emerging markets, such as Northern and Southern Africa , Central and Southern Asia , Middle East and Latin America , continued to make remarkable progresses.\" \n \n\"We successfully repaid the RMB1.2 billion three-year unsecured medium-term notes due in May 2015 , and we are actively taking measures to prepare for repayment of the RMB1.0 billion five-year unsecured medium-term notes when they become due this October and are exploring a number of financing options including liquidation of idle assets, introduction of strategic investors and potential new cooperation model with our business partners. Also, for our downstream project development business, we have adopted and will follow a core principle of 'less investment, and quicker turnover' in order to maintain a stable cash flow. We believe these measures will help us to enhance our cash position, and allow us to gradually improve our balance sheet.\" Mr. Miao concluded. \n \nSecond Quarter 2015 Financial Results \n \nTotal Net Revenues \n \nTotal net revenues were RMB2,716.1 million ( US$438.1 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB2,905.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB3,408.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. Total PV module shipments (including 43.2MW shipments for PV systems of the Company's own downstream PV projects) were 727.9MW in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 754.2MW in the first quarter of 2015 and 887.9MW in the second quarter of 2014. Revenues were not recognized for 43.2MW of internal shipments as required by U.S. GAAP. \n \nThe decrease in total net revenues in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2015 was mainly due to a decrease of PV module shipments in the second quarter of 2015 and decline in the average selling price of PV modules, which was primarily due to higher proportion of our shipment to China market and the depreciation of Euro and Japanese Yen against Renminbi in the quarter. \n \nGross Profit and Gross Margin \n \nGross profit was RMB171.0 million ( US$27.6 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB410.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB532.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. \n \nGross margin was 6.3% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 14.1% in the first quarter of 2015 and 15.6% in the second quarter of 2014. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015 was mainly due to the decline in average selling price of PV modu les a nd the increase in unit manufacturing cost as a result of a lower utilization rate of production facilities in the second quarter of 2015. Gross margin on sales of PV modules was 7.9% in the second quarter of 2015. \n \nOperating Expenses \n \nOperating expenses decreased to RMB349.3 million ( US$56.3 million ) in the second quarter of 2015 from RMB477.2 million in the first quarter of 2015, and compared to RMB618.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decrease in operating expenses from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015 was mainly due to the recognition of a gain from disposal of the land use rights held by Fine Silicon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yingli Green Energy. \n \nOperating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 12.9 % in the second quarter of 2015, reduced from 16.4% in the first quarter of 2015 and 18.1% in the second quarter of 2014. \n \nOperating Loss and Margin \n \nOperating loss was RMB178.3 million ( US$28.8 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to operating loss of RMB66.4 million in the first quarter of 2015 and operating loss of RMB85.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. \n \nOperating margin was negative 6.6% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to negative 2.3% in the first quarter of 2015 and negative 2.5% in the second quarter of 2014. \n \nEBITDA \n \nOn an adjusted non-GAAP basis, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax expenses, depreciation and amortization) were RMB198.8 million ( US$32.1 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB199.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB279.3 million in the second quarter of 2014. \n \nInterest Expense \n \nInterest expense was RMB242.1 million ( US$39.1 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB236.8 million in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB232.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. The weighted average interest rate was 6.75% in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 6.76% in the first quarter of 2015 and 6.25% in the second quarter of 2014. \n \nForeign Currency Exchange Loss (Gain) \n \nForeign currency exchange loss was RMB10.3 million ( US$1.7 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to foreign currency exchange loss of RMB130.6 million in the first quarter of 2015 and foreign currency exchange gain of RMB2.8 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decrease in foreign currency exchange loss from the first quarter of 2015 was mainly due to less fluctuation of the exchange rates between Euros and Renminbi in the second quarter of 2015. \n \nIncome Tax Expense \n \nIncome tax expense was RMB232.6 million ( US$37.5 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to income tax expense of RMB0.5 million in the first quarter of 2015 and income tax expense of RMB1.2 million in the second quarter of 2014. The significant increase in income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015 mainly resulted from RMB200.0 million of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets recognized in this quarter and areversal of deferred income tax assets of Fine Silicon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Yingli Green Energy . \n \nNet Loss \n \nNet loss was RMB598.1 million ( US$96.5 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB363.2 million in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB285.2 million in the second quarter of 2014. Loss per ordinary share and per ADS was RMB3.29  (US$0.53) , compared to RMB2.00 in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB1.64 in the second quarter of 2014. \n \nOn an adjusted non-GAAP basis, net loss was RMB596.9 million ( US$96.3 million ) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB353.0 million in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB275.0 million in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted non-GAAP loss per ordinary share and per ADS was RMB3.28  (US$0.53) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to RMB1.94 in the first quarter of 2015 and RMB1.58 in the second quarter of 2014. \n \nBalance Sheet Analysis \n \nAs of June 30, 2015 , the Company had RMB575.0 million ( US$92.7 million ) in cash and cash equivalents, compared to RMB1,140.9 million as of March 31, 2015 . The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to the repayment of the medium-term notes in the principal amount of RMB 1.2 billion due in May 2015 . \n \nAs of June 30, 2015 , the Company had RMB1,201.8 million ( US$193.8 million ) in restricted cash, compared to RMB1,323.2 million as of March 31, 2015 . \n \nAs of June 30, 2015 , the Company's accounts receivable had decreased to RMB3,854.4 million ( US$621.7 million ) from RMB4,320.6 million as of March 31, 2015 . Days sales outstanding were [128] days in the second quarter of 2015, compared to 134 days in the first quarter of 2015. \n \nAs of June 30, 2015 , the Company's accounts payable had decreased to RMB5,432.2 million ( US$876.2 million ) from RMB5,617.1 million as of March 31, 2015 . Days payable outstanding were 192 days in the second quarter of 2015, decreased from 203 days in the first quarter of 2015. \n \nAs of June 30, 2015 , the Company's inventory had decreased to RMB1,522.4 million ( US$245.6 million ) from RMB2,020.3 million as of March 31, 2015 . Inventory turnover days were 54 days in the second quarter of 2015, decreased from 73 days in the first quarter of 2015. \n \nAs of the date of this press release, the Company had approximately RMB 6,627 million in unutilized short-term lines of credit and approximately RMB 1,195 million in committed long-term fac ilities. The Company repaid the RMB1.2 billion three-year unsecured medium-term notes when they became due in May 2015 . For the R MB 1.0 billion five-year unsecured medium-term notes du e in October 2015, the Company is exploring various measures for the repayment of these notes . The C ompany is also working on a number of financing options to continue to manage the Company's liquidity and to enhance its financial flexibility. \n \nDownstream Development in 2015 \n \nIn China , the Company began the construction of 78 MW of PV projects and connected 94 MW of PV projects to the grid in the second quarter 2015. As of June 30, 2015 , the Company had a total of over 400 MW of PV projects under construction across a dozen provinces in China . \n \nIn July, the Company was selected to develop and construct a 50 MW PV project in Shanxi Province , China , which will be one of the key demonstration projects of National Energy Administration's \"Top Runner\" program. \n \nIn consideration of China's nationwide delay in subsidy allocation, long-term operation of large ground-mounted PV stations would require significant capital. Accordingly, the Company has adopted a more prudent approach to downstream project development business and is in active negotiations with certain leading corporations about potential sale of the PV projects developed by the Company. The Company has approximately 100MW of PV projects sold or close to sale to those parties. \n \nExpected Non-Cash Impairment Charge on Long Lived Assets in Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 \n \nAs a result of the lower-than-expected utilization of certain production facilities of the Company in the second quarter of 2015 and the expected continuation of such utilization in the remaining quarters of 2015, the Company has concluded that impairment triggering events have become apparent in the third quarter of 2015 and has begun the process of performing its long-lived asset impairment analysis with respect to those production facilities. While the impairment analysis has not been completed yet, the Company expects to recognize a significant amount of non-cash impairment charge on those production facilities in the third quarter of 2015, which will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results for the third quarter of 2015 and fiscal year 2015. \n \nBusiness Outlook for Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2015 \n \nThird Quarter of 2015 \n \nBased on current market conditions, the Company's current operating conditions, estimated production capacity and forecasted customer demand, the Company expects its PV module shipments to be in the estimated range of 550 MW to 580 MW for the quarter ending September 30, 2015 . \n \nFiscal Year 2015 \n \nBased on current market conditions, the Company's current operating conditions, estimated production capacity and forecasted customer demand, the Company expects its total PV module shipments to be 2.5 GW to 2.8 GW for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 . \n \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n \nTo supplement the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating loss, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per ordinary share and per ADS and EBITDA, each of which (other than EBITDA) is adjusted to exclude, as applicable, items related to share-based compensation, interest expense related to the changes in the fair value of the interest-rate swap and the amortization of the debt discount, the amortization of intangible assets, inventory provision and non-cash provision for inventory purchase commitments. EBITDA excludes interest, tax expenses, depreciation and amortization. The Company believes excluding these items from its non-GAAP financial measures is useful for its management and investors to assess and analyze the Company's on-going performance as such items are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company's business operations and\/or do not impact its cash earnings. The Company also believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important to help investors understand the Company's current financial performance and future prospects and compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the financial information included elsewhere in this press release. \n \nCurrency Conversion \n \nSolely for the convenience of readers, certain Renminbi amounts have been translated into U.S. dollar amounts at the rate of RMB6.2000 to US$1.00 , the noon buying rate in New York for cable transfers of Renminbi per U.S. dollar as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board as of June 30, 2015 . No representation is intended to imply that these translated Renminbi amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into U.S. dollar amounts at such rate, or at any other rate. The percentages stated in this press release are calculated based on Renminbi amounts. \n \nConference Call \n \nYingli Green Energy will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss these results at 8:00 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on September 8, 2015 , which corresponds to 8:00 PM Beijing\/ Hong Kong time on the same day. \n \nThe dial-in details for the live conference call are as follows: \n \n-- U.S. Toll Free Number: +1-866-519-4004 \n \n-- International Dial-in Number: +1-845-675-0437 \n \n-- Passcode: 14832918 \n \nA live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available on the Investors section of Yingli Green Energy's website at www.yinglisolar.com .

Nicolet Road in Grand Chute. \n\nIts large, luxurious jewelry boutique space, between Willows Bend and Gather Americana, is familiar to high-end shoppers as it once was Earth Resources founded by the late John Barlow and owned by his daughter Alice. \n\nStudio 247 is making good use of Earth Resources\u2019 wood-trimmed glass jewelry cases and counters for its red carpet-worthy classic necklaces and earrings. \n\nCraig Slavens, Studio 247 co-owner, knows the space well as he was a jewelry designer at Earth Resources for three years, several years before its 2012 closure. \n\nStudio 247 is a different kind of jewelry store, he said, because it doesn\u2019t just carry high-end and custom jewelry. \n\nBracelet designed by Craig Slavens of Studio 247 Fine Jewelry in Grand Chute. \u00a0 (Photo: Courtesy of Craig Slavens) \n\n\u201cWe have unusual, one-of-a-kind pieces in every price range,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cIt has upscale decor, and we love the space, but we want everyone to feel comfortable. Sure, we want the $40,000 sale, but we don\u2019t want someone with a few hundred to spend to feel out of place. One woman just purchased a pair of amber earrings for $245.\u201d \n\nHe and shop co-owner Milada Rice added wedding rings and displays of wear-everyday jewelry that can be as little as $50 for a handmade pair of sterling silver earrings. An estate jewelery counter includes cameos that had been\u00a0photographed for\u00a0Vogue. \n\nRice is also assembling a side room\u00a0of vintage accessories, starting with her grandmother\u2019s own high-end collection of handbags, shoes and hats. Their\u00a0family operates Rice Family Industries and Waupaca Elevator Co. \n\nSlavens, a Californian, is a gemologist, designer and expert on both rare pink diamonds and diamond grading. One of his designs in the shop is a pink pear-shaped diamond ring for $42,500. \n\nA rare pink pear-shaped diamond is paired with white diamonds in Craig Slavens' \"bypass\" ring design. \u00a0 (Photo: Courtesy of Craig Slavens) \n\nWhen he learned this space was available, he began working on a plan for it with the Rice family.\u00a0 After Earth Resources, he moved to Arkansas, near family, and continued to design and manufacture his own high end jewelry line. He earned an American Gem Trade Association Spectrum Design Award for a bridal necklace in 2012. \n\nThe new jewelry shop could easily fit into a larger city. \n\n\u201cI like Wisconsin, I like the people, the seasons, the cost of living,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may sell more elsewhere, but you have a higher overhead. I enjoy the customers here. They\u2019re real.\u201d \n\nMeanwhile, Rice said anyone who knew Slavens would be happy he has returned.\u00a0\u201cEveryone loves Craig,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s down to earth and very kind.\u201d \n\nFor more information: see Facebook or call 920-903-8716.

General Assembly. \n\nDevelopment programs are working, Obama said, but results can improve if the U.S. and other countries can address such issues\u00a0as bad governance; gender, racial, and income inequality; fulfilling the economic potential of Africa; and the ravages of wars. \n\nObama also cited the global challenge\u00a0he plans to emphasize throughout\u00a0his U.N. meetings: climate change. \"All of our countries will be affected by a changing climate,\" Obama said, especially poorer nations. \n\nAs Obama flew to New York City aboard Air Force One early Sunday, the White House announced an addition to his U.N. schedule: the Tuesday meeting with Castro, Obama's second face-to-face with the communist leader\u00a0since the U.S. and Cuba restored diplomatic relations in late 2014. \n\nThey met in April on the sidelines of a Summit of Americas meeting in Panama.\u00a0The two also spoke by phone earlier this month, before the visit of Pope Francis to both Cuba and the United States. \n\nThis is Castro's first trip to the annual opening of the U.N. General Assembly. \n\nAfter speaking at\u00a0a mid-afternoon meeting on the\u00a0U.N.'s\u00a0global development agenda,\u00a0Obama visited\u00a0the U.S. mission to the United Nations to meet with employees and their families. \n\nObama turns to domestic politics Sunday evening as he delivers remarks at a Democratic National Committee LGBT gala. \n\nIn addition to his annual address to the countries that make up the U.N. General Assembly \u2014 something Obama will do Monday morning \u2014 United Nations week gives the president a chance to meet one-on-one with a select group of other world leaders. \n\nIn addition to Castro,\u00a0Obama's meeting list this year includes India Prime Minister Narendra Modi,\u00a0President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, and\u00a0a potentially tense session with Russia President Vladimir Putin. \n\nTopics for the Putin meeting include U.S. objections to what it calls Russian aggression in Ukraine and concern about a Russian military build-up in Syria. \n\n\"Our support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine will be front and center throughout our discussions,\" said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. \n\nU.S. officials have also criticized Russian support for embattled Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. \n\nPutin, who authorized a Russian annexation of the Ukraine area,\u00a0says he will protect the interests of ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine, and still objects to what he has called a 2014 \"coup\" of a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine. \n\nAs for Syria, Putin says he wants to help fight the Islamic State, and he criticized the U.S. for backing Syrian rebels seeking to topple Assad. \n\nThe American\u00a0\"provision of military support to illegal structures runs counter to the principles of modern international law and the United Nations charter,\" Putin said on CBS' 60 Minutes. \n\nThe White House also said Sunday that, during\u00a0his Air Force One flight, Obama spoke by phone\u00a0with Chilean President\u00a0\u00a0Michelle Bachelet. \n\nIn addition to discussing the proposed\u00a0Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, Obama also offered Bachelet condolences for a Sept. 16 earthquake in Chile \"and inquired about the status of rebuilding and recovery efforts.\" \n\nFollow @djusatoday on Twitter","title":"Obama to meet with Raul Castro at United Nations - USA TODAY","media-type":"News","source":"Mount Olive Tribune","published":"2015-09-27T20:43:10Z"}

The investigation has not yet determined whether this was caused by an attempted ejection or the impact of the crash. \n \nAccording to the interim report the Hawker Hunter was not fitted with a flight recorder but there were  two \"image recording cameras\" mounted within the cockpit. \n   Promoted stories   \nOne was located between the two seats, giving a partial view of the pilot and instrument panel, as well as a view through the cockpit canopy and windscreen. \n \nThe report stated: \"To date no abnormal indications have been identified. \n \n\"Throughout the flight, the aircraft appeared to be responding to the pilot's control inputs.\" \n \nThe other camera was mounted at the base of the windscreen looking over the nose. \n \nThe preliminary report noted that investigators have  received a \"large amount\" of video and photographs of the aircraft from various locations around Shoreham Airport, where the airshow was taking place. \n \nMany of these are in  high definition and will be analysed in a bid to determine the parameters of the jet's manoeuvres, including flight path and speed. \n \nThe AAIB said  the pilot carried out a pre-flight inspection before taking off from North Weald Airfield, Essex, to fly to Shoreham and there were \"no reported defects\". \n \nThe document added: \"The pilot was described as being in good spirits and looking forward to the flight.\" \n \nMost of the aircraft w reckage has been recovered and sent to the AAIB's headquarters in Farnborough, Hampshire. Work continues to locate some small pieces of the plane. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nThe victims have been named as retired engineer  James Graham Mallinson, 72, from Newick,  near Lewes;  window cleaner and  general builder Mark Trussler, 54, from Worthing; cycling friends Dylan Archer,  42, from Brighton, and Richard Smith, 26, from Hove; NHS manager Tony  Brightwell, 53, from Hove; grandfather Mark Reeves, 53, from Seaford; Worthing  United footballers Matthew Grimstone and Jacob Schilt, both 23; personal trainer  Matt Jones, 24; wedding chauffeur Maurice Abrahams, 76; and Daniele Polito, 23,  from Worthing. \n \nThe inquest into their deaths was opened and adjourned at a hearing in Horsham on Wednesday.","title":"Shoreham crash jet showed 'no abnormal indications' during flight","media-type":"News","source":"Hampshire Chronicle","published":"2015-09-04T16:10:22Z"}

Shortly after the story was published, Clinton's campaign released a statement calling on Congress to repeal the tax. \n\nUnion members, many of whom enjoy the generous employer-based coverage plans, would be hit by the 40% tax, which applies to plans with yearly premiums exceeding $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families. \n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and a longtime Clinton supporter, praised the former secretary of state's decision. \n\n\"We are proud that Hillary Clinton has come out in favor of a repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax -- a harmful tax on health benefits that is hurting America's working families,\" she said. \"This tax already is being used by employers to shift an increasing share of health care costs to employees.\" \n\nBut many health care experts who view the tax as a crucial part of the Obamacare law are critical of Clinton's position. \n\n\"The smarter move is to leave well enough alone and allow this tax to take effect,\" said Jared Bernstein, a former White House economist and senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in a Washington Post op-ed earlier this year. \"After decades of fighting for it, we're finally moving towards a more rational, efficient health care system.

{"id":"0c8dd7ae-2b1c-4e11-84dd-db7422343d50","content":"PTI \nSRINAGAR \n \nA year after the devastating floods struck Jammu and Kashmir, former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah today asked the Centre to allow international aid to the state if it did not have money or was unwilling to announce any package for rehabilitation of victims. \n \n\u201cWe want that aid should come from wherever it can. If the Centre is not ready to give financial aid, or it does not have the money, then we should be allowed to get it from where we are getting it (internationally),\u201d Omar told reporters after donating blood as part of his party\u2019s blood donation camp to mark the first anniversary of the floods here. \n \nOmar, who is working president of opposition National Conference (NC), said people of the state had suffered from both sides, as neither had the Centre given any package nor did it allow any international aid. \n \n\u201cWe (the previous NC-Congress government) had started the process of getting international aid by talking to the World Bank. The first meeting, I had with the officials of World Bank and Asian Development Bank before the election code (came into force).\u201d \n \n\u201cWe had prepared a project but there has been no forward movement on that as well. So, we suffered from both the sides. Neither did we get anything from here, nor from where we would have got some money,\u201d the former chief minister said. \n \nTerming as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the ruling Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) decision to celebrate the anniversary of the floods, Omar said, \u201c\u2026The reality is that the people, who were affected by the floods, have got nothing to celebrate.\u201d He said, now, the high court had to take a suo motu notice as a result of \u201cnon-efficiency\u201d of this government. \n \n\u201cThe court has compelled the state as well as the central government to answer. Now, we hope that due to high court\u2019s pressure, people would get something which these people (governments) were unwilling to give till now. They were not ready to give the people anything on their own. Whatever,I had given to people during my regime, they had got nothing more than that,\u201d the former chief minister said. \n \nOmar claimed whatever assistance the flood-affected people got was before March 1. \n \n\u201cSince the PDP-BJP government was sworn-in (March 1), they (victims) have been continuously neglected. Rs 2000-Rs 2500 crore fund that they got with much difficulty was the money from State Disaster Relief Fund and first instalment from Government of India which was announced on the spot during my regime. Not a penny extra,\u201d he alleged. \n \nThe NC leader alleged the Centre took back money which it had given to the state on the account of various expenditures. \n \n\u201cThey took money for many things in the name of flood relief. But those, who suffered losses, did not get anything. Helicopters were used, (but) the money was taken from us. Their boats were used here, but the money was taken from us. The funds meant for liabilities under Prime Minister\u2019s Reconstruction Programme were taken in the name of floods. \n \n\u201cAdditional special plan assistance, which is given to us by the Planning Commission every year to balance our plan, that money was also added to the flood account and taken. That is why, Mufti sahab felt a compulsion to arrest the leaders of trade bodies who were to protest against the government,\u201d Omar said. \n \nCondemning the arrest of leaders of various trade bodies, he said, the chief minister is the same Sayeed who used to say that this is the battle of ideas, but the reality is, if your ideas do not match his, he will not allow you to talk. \n \n\u201cYou (governments) are pushing the people unnecessarily. These traders were not protesting against any country. They were not coming out with anti-national slogans. They were coming out for their rights. \n \n\u201cThe rights which they have been promised of by none other than the Prime Minister of the country who, here in Srinagar, said that we will not only give whatever to this part of Kashmir, but are even ready to help the other side of Kashmir as well. \n \n\u201cThank God, they (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) did not took the help, otherwise their situation would have been same like ours. It is unfortunate that they (leaders of trade bodies) have been arrested for bringing these things to the public domain,\u201d he said. \n \nOmar, in a series of tweets, termed the chief minister as \u201cdictator\u201d for carrying out midnight raids and arrest of trader body leaders. \n \n\u201cIn a series of midnight raids (chief Minister) Mufti (Mohammad) Syed has ensured the arrest of all the Trade Body leaders. Their crime? Unhappiness over flood relief. All these people wanted to do was register their dissatisfaction at the absence of any meaningful flood relief. Shame on Mufti the Dictator,\u201d he tweeted. \n \n\u201cIf Mufti Sb (sahab) was so sure people were going to celebrate as his Govt (government) has planned today he wouldn\u2019t have ordered these arrests. #Dictator,\u201d he said. \n \n\u00a0","title":"Govt should allow international aid for flood victims, says Omar","media-type":"News","source":"Navhind Times","published":"2015-09-07T19:12:02Z"}

And, if you have a PC, your machine runs on a Microsoft operating system. \n\nSound familiar? \n\nIf it does, you\u2019re in luck because the new Windows 10 is finally here and there are plenty of reasons to love this new operating system. \u201cMicrosoft combined the best features of Windows 7 and Windows 8,\u201d says tech guru, Mario Armstrong. Windows 10 has been designed to offer you optimal performance on every device it runs so you can enjoy a Windows 7-like experience when using your computer or a Windows 8 experience on your mobile device. \n\nWindows 10 also offers a free personal assistant, built-in apps, increased photo and map capabilities and all the tools you need to manage your obligations with improved mail and calendar options, along with more opportunities to have some fun with movies, shows and music. \n\nSo how do you transition to Windows 10? It\u2019s easier than you think and to help you through the process, Armstrong offers these tips: \n\n* Back it up. Whether you decide to upgrade your current computer to Windows 10 or to buy a new Windows 10 powered device, it\u2019s always a good idea to take some time and make sure all of your important files have been backed up. Get an external hard drive and use Microsoft\u2019s free Backup and Restore software to copy all of your files over. This way, if something goes wrong, you\u2019ll know everything is safe and sound. \n\n* Trust it to the professionals. Upgrading can be a scary process, since it\u2019s possible to lose files or forget to uninstall certain drivers. Create your own safety net by taking advantage of the Staples EasyTech program and a knowledgeable Staples associate will upgrade your computer to Windows 10 for free. Just call or head into a local store to make an appointment and you\u2019ll be running Windows 10 in no time. Any device running Windows 7 or later is eligible. \n\n* Find the right device for your new operating system. Before you enact a Windows 10 upgrade, you need to figure out if you\u2019ll be upgrading your current computer or transitioning to a new device. The good news is if your current laptop, tablet or hybrid device runs Windows 7 or Windows 8 already, it can probably handle Windows 10\u2019s system requirements, but you should double check to make sure. If your computer barely meets the minimum requirements but runs fine, you should hold off on upgrading until you can afford a new device. Even though Windows 10 is free for most people, adding it to an older device may slow the device down. You can learn more about upgrading for free from Microsoft\u2019s site. \n\nFor PC users, Windows 10 offers them the chance to use and enjoy their devices like never before and upgrading is easy. Simply follow Armstrong\u2019s tips before you upgrade and visit your local Staples store for help. Then, your old companion will have a new and exciting look and feel in no time.","title":"3 easy steps to upgrade your computer to the latest operating system","media-type":"News","source":"Tate County Democrat","published":"2015-09-10T01:05:02Z"}

Governor Tom Wolf launched Pennsylvania's Medicaid expansion plan in April 2015 . Since the launch, more than 200,000 new Pennsylvanians have enrolled in HealthChoices, which now provides health care coverage to more Pennsylvanians than ever before. \n\n\"When fully implemented, these new changes will mark the most significant changes to Medicaid in Pennsylvania since the Department first moved to mandatory managed care 18 years ago,\" said Secretary Dallas. \"We must continue to innovate and move forward if we are going to provide the high-quality health care that all Pennsylvanians deserve. As the biggest insurance payor in the commonwealth, our hope is that these changes will encourage innovation in the private sector as well.\" \n\nFirst, DHS issued a request for proposals (RFP) for physical health services provided through HealthChoices, Pennsylvania's mandatory Medicaid managed care program since 1997. \n\n\"If you pay for services, you will get services.\u00a0 If you pay for outcomes, you will get outcomes,\" said Dallas. \"When awarded, the contracts will require the managed care organizations (MCOs) to increase the amount of money they spend on contracts that reward value, care coordination, and better health outcomes rather than simply paying for services as they are provided. The result will be a system that focuses more on the patient as a whole and provides higher quality care to those in the Medicaid system.\" \n\nTo drive Pennsylvania's Medicaid system towards these better outcomes, the new contracts will set targets for all contracted MCOs to increase the percentage of value-based or outcome-based contracts they have with hospitals, doctors, and other providers to 30 percent of medical funds they receive from DHS within three years. The result will be that billions of dollars will be invested in options such as: \naccountable care organizations (voluntary networks of hospitals, doctors, and other providers that work together to provide coordinated care to patients); \u00a0  bundled payments (increases value-based purchasing);  patient-centered medical homes; and  other performance-based payments.\u00a0 \nThe contracts will also include better integration of the physical and behavioral health systems and approaches like telemedicine to help serve areas of the state that do not have easy access to doctors. \n  \nSecond, DHS, in partnership with the Pennsylvania Department of Aging, released a more detailed concept paper outlining its vision for Community HealthChoices (CHC), Governor Tom Wolf's managed long-term services and supports program to support older individuals and adults with physical disabilities ( click here for the release regarding the concept paper). The plan is an integrated system of physical health and long-term services and supports (LTSS) which focuses on improving health outcomes and allowing individuals to live safe and healthy lives with as much independence as possible. \n\nCHC is a significant shift from the commonwealth's current, fractured approach to providing these services and will enhance care for seniors and persons with disabilities through better coordination of care. The result will be that more Pennsylvanians will be served in the community instead of in nursing homes or other facilities.\u00a0 \n\nCHC will support individuals dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, older adults and adults with physical disabilities in the most integrated settings possible. CHC will serve an estimated 450,000 individuals, including 130,000 older persons and adults with physical disabilities who are currently receiving LTSS in the community and in nursing facilities. \n\nHealthChoices delivers quality medical care and timely access to all appropriate services to 2.5 million children, individuals with disabilities, pregnant women, and low-income Pennsylvanians. \n\nFor more information on Community HealthChoices, visit www.dhs.state.pa.us .

{"id":"93ff308f-ba2b-419a-be5f-ecc580db222e","content":"WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) -- Apple said Monday it sold 13 million of its new iPhones over the weekend, in a record-breaking launch for the latest model of its iconic smartphone. \n\n\r\nThe California tech giant began selling the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in nine markets, including China, on Friday. \n\n\r\nOn Monday, the company said the devices will be available in 40 additional markets October 9 including Italy, Mexico, Russia, Spain and Taiwan. \n\n\r\n\"Sales for iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus have been phenomenal, blowing past any previous first weekend sales results in Apple's history,\" said chief executive Tim Cook. \n\n\r\nApple has also unveiled new lease and finance terms for US customers, which analysts said could boost sales and shorten the upgrade cycle, at a time when carriers are moving away from smartphone subsidies. \n\n\r\nThe iPhone 6S and 6S Plus have the same overall dimensions as the last version, with new technologies under the hood. \n\n\r\nOne of the key new features is called \"3D touch,\" which responds to the level of pressure exerted on the screen, allowing users to apply light pressure to peek at messages and applications, and to press a little deeper to open them. \n\n\r\nThe 6S has the 4.7-inch (about 12-centimeter) display of its predecessor and the 6S Plus -- which updates one of the more popular handsets in the \"phablet category\" -- has the same 5.5-inch screen. \n\n\r\nBut the devices have more powerful processors that allow for improved graphics, harder glass and a new aluminum body. Pricing will be kept at the same levels as the earlier versions. \n\n\r\nThe record launch outpaced last year's release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus which sold more than 10 million, but did not include China, which was among the markets for the newest iPhone launch. \n\n\r\nAnalysts at IHS Technology project that Apple will ship 236 million iPhones this year, up 22 per cent from a year ago. \n\n\r\nIHS analyst Ian Fogg said Apple is likely to have another blockbuster quarter or two but could have trouble sustaining momentum next year. \n\n\r\n\"By the middle of next year, this look and feel will be almost two years old,\" Fogg told AFP. \n\n\r\nFor its next model, he said, \"Apple is going to have to find a way to reinvent the iPhone, and it is hard to find something that is radically new.\" \n\n\r\nApple's new phone also features upgraded operating system iOS 9, which the company says offers \"more intelligence\" while taking up less space. \n\n\r\nApple said that it will roll out the new devices to more markets in the coming weeks and that they would be available in 130 countries by the end of the year.","title":"Apple sells record 13 mn iPhones in weekend launch","media-type":"News","source":"Jamaica Observer","published":"2015-09-30T02:00:00Z"}

The challenge to keep that unofficial title could be as tough as getting to the Super Bowl. \n \nWith new ballparks to debut in Minneapolis next year and Atlanta in 2017, keeping up with what fans want from technology is an endless process for NFL teams. \n \n''We try to do that every year, have a new offering, whether through our app or experiential,'' says Charlotte Jones Anderson, the Cowboys' executive vice president and chief brand officer. ''This year, we have a DraftKings fantasy sports lounge for our fans interested in playing and engaging in fantasy football.'' \n \nBecause AT&T is a partner and has naming rights to the Cowboys' building, Anderson believes the team has an edge in the tech world. Another corporate giant, IBM is helping design and implement the technology for the Falcons' new home. \n \nIBM is trying to make sure the infrastructure for Mercedes-Benz Stadium doesn't need to be replaced as technology advances. \n \n''It's critical to have future flexibility over time,'' says John Armstrong, North American leader for IBM interactive experience. \n \nBut it takes more than strong Wi-Fi to make football fans leave their living rooms and big screen TVs to pay for expensive tickets, parking and concessions at the stadium. . \n \nThe Cowboys think their fan app is a difference maker. It provides traffic updates, best routes into the parking lots, directions to your seat and ticket management. Fans can provide instant feedback when there is an issue such as long lines at the gates or rest room\/concession problems. \n \nThe team has added touchscreens in the stadium on which fans can look up player bios, the history of the Cowboys cheerleaders, or descriptions of the stadium's art collection. \n \nIt's easier than ever to gauge what the fans want technologically, because they let teams know through social media. Many new of the Atlanta stadium's new accoutrements are based on fan feedback. \n \n''To really have the lens of the fan as the guide is challenging,'' IBM's Armstrong says. ''Certainly there are lots of things we can do technology-wise, but if you don't have the lens of the fan in mind you could almost get carried away, doing things for the sake of technological things. But the question you always must be able to answer is: Does this add to the enjoyment of the event and the experience of the fan, or is it a whiz-bang trick that is distracting?'' \n \nFalcons owner Arthur Blank has said that what the fan will experience on the first day for his stadium in 2017 will not be the same experience the next year. New stats might provide instant analysis to fans' seats. New technologies might allow new ways for fans to see or share content. \n \nHow teams deliver that info at the games could be crucial to getting fans into the seats. \n \n''They are there to see a live event and that is, foremost, the football game,'' Armstrong says. ''The Falcons and many other sports organizations are supremely focused on what it takes to create the depth for engaging their fans - to have that mindshare of the fan and the consumer.'' \n \n--- \n \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com\/AP-NFL","title":"Ramping up technology a key for fans at NFL stadiums","media-type":"News","source":"FoxBangor.com","published":"2015-09-08T21:17:37Z"}

{"id":"29d9ebb9-8196-4701-a431-0edd1645723f","content":"School can be difficult. But are you encouraging or hindering your child's success? Here are 10 habits you may not realize are damaging to his or her success in school. 1. Forget about tomorrow morning. Let her stay up late! It\u2019s not like she needs a full nights\u2019 rest to do well in school; she can sleep in her desk! Besides, she hates bedtime and it\u2019s so much easier to let her stay up with you and watch some of those funny late night television shows. 2. Don\u2019t ask her about her homework every day or how school is going. You don\u2019t want to be a nag. She\u2019s probably got it all figured out and will get great grades without your getting involved. 3. Don\u2019t worry about grades until a week or two before they come out. You have plenty of time! Your schedule is too busy anyway to be bogged down with your child\u2019s education. If she misses class or a few assignments here and there, the teacher will gladly accept them until the last day of the term and if he doesn\u2019t, you can just call the principal and she\u2019ll sort it all out. 4. Yell at your child until she gets her homework done. Ground her and take away her cell phone. That\u2019s how you really get someone motivated to work hard. If she complains, tell her you walked to school uphill both ways in the snow with no shoes; she\u2019ll quickly realize that she\u2019s being ungrateful and get right to work. 5. Don\u2019t worry about attending Parent-Teacher Conference. That teacher couldn\u2019t have anything helpful to say about how she is doing in his class. After all, what did he do with his life? He\u2019s just a teacher. He better just shape up and do what you say, after all; you\u2019re the parent and you pay taxes. 6. Whenever she has a doctor or dentist appointment, be sure to make that appointment during her hardest class. It will give her a much needed break and it\u2019s not like you\u2019re worried about her making up the work. That\u2019s the teacher\u2019s problem, not yours. 7. Don\u2019t worry about whether your child has breakfast before she heads to school. School is early enough; it\u2019s not worth getting up earlier to make breakfast. Besides, it\u2019s not like learning is a bodily function; it\u2019s more of a brain function. Page 2 of 2 - 8. Don\u2019t praise your child if she does something well in school; it will just go to her head. Your job is to motivate her by pointing out only the things she does wrong. After all, if you don\u2019t say it, who will? 9. If you have a complaint, always go straight to the top! Principals love to get involved in every little situation; that\u2019s why they\u2019re called princi-\u201cpals.\u201d 10. Don\u2019t worry about setting a good example of continued learning. You already went to school! Been there, done that. You have too much work to do now to fit in reading a good book or showing your child that you still love art. Never talk about what inspired you to get where you are today; that will just bore her.","title":"10 ways you're helping your child fail in school and don't even realize it","media-type":"News","source":"Canton Repository","published":"2015-09-19T03:18:47Z"}

He also described how he caught \"the space bug\" by watching Saturn V rockets launch from the cape's famed launch site. \n\nThose launch pads have been dormant for 10 years, Bezos said, adding that it's \"too long \u2014 we can't wait to fix that,\" in a comment that drew applause from the crowd. \n\nBlue Origin will work toward putting people into orbit around the Earth from Cape Canaveral, relying on reusable orbital launchers that will be built in Florida.

Blue Origin recently said that it hopes to qualify the engine for flight in 2017, with the first flight of the Vulcan rocket system planned for two years later. \n\nThe company says that testing of the BE-4 engine has been underway \"for more than three years and testing of the BE-4 components is ongoing at Blue Origin's test facilities in West Texas.\" \n\nIn April, Blue Origin carried out the first test flight of its reusable New Shepard space vehicle at its Texas facility.","title":"Amazon's Bezos Announces Plan To Build, Launch Rockets From Florida","media-type":"News","source":"Wyoming Public Media","published":"2015-09-15T15:04:00Z"}

Chutima had worked as a paid fixer for Reuters on its Rohingya coverage and introduced Reuters reporters to news sources.\n\nReuters, one of the world's largest media and information companies, distanced itself from the case.\n\nProsecution witnesses gave no explanation in court as to why only Phuketwan was charged.\n\nDefence lawyers argued in court that the Reuters paragraph quoting a people smuggler saying \"Thai naval forces\" sometimes earned money or turned a blind eye to Rohingya boats did not name the Royal Thai Navy and that there were multiple naval forces in Thailand, including the coastguard and police. That argument went uncontested in court.\n\nIn the indictment the words \"Thai naval forces\" was erroneously translated into \"Royal Thai Navy\", the court was told.\n\nDefence lawyers also questioned whether a branch of the armed forces could sue for defamation when no individuals were identified as being aggrieved by the story.\n\nThey also argued the Computer Crimes Act should not be applied in defamation cases.\n\nMorison and Chutima earlier this year sent a letter to Thai authorities expressing \"deep regret\" at what had transpired but insisted an apology was not warranted.\n\n\"We had no intention of apologising for something that we haven't done,\" Morison said. \"This was a matter of important principle. This case was wrong from the beginning, with one or two officers acting on bad advice.\"\n\nMorison could have left Thailand to avoid the trial but said he had stayed to fight the case with Chutima in the interests of media freedom.\n\nAfter the verdict, Morison said he would consider the future of Phuketwan in the coming days. \"Fighting the case has been a huge financial and personal burden,\" he said.\n\nPhil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, said: \"This whole episode shows a fundamental lack of understanding among Thai government and military officials about what a free press is really about and the role it plays in democratic society.\n\n\"Thailand needs to revoke both its criminal defamation statute and the Computer Crimes Act to end this assault on media freedom.\"\n\nKingsley Abbott, from the International Commission of Jurists, said while the acquittals are very welcome, \"Thailand must now move to abolish criminal defamation, which is an abuse of freedom of expression and is out of line with its international legal obligations\".

According to one of the sales team, over 5,000 have been sold, and orders are coming in for another 2,000 red shirts to be picked up later. \n \nBut who is the September 16 rally organiser? Datuk Jamal Md Yunus (in black suit with specs) holds up a red T-shirt that reads in Bahasa Malaysia: Malay dignity uprising, Padang Merbok, Bukit Bintang, Petaling Street, My Homeland. \n \nAccording to Datuk Jamal Md Yunos who heads a self-styled coalition of Malay non-government organisations that is facilitating sales of the red T-shirts and will help to mobilise participation on that day, the organiser is a little-known Malay rights group called Pesaka. \n \n\u201cThe rally organiser is Pesaka. We\u2019re just helping with mobilising the rally,\u201d Jamal who is also Sungai Besar Umno division chief told Malay Mail Online when met at the booth sale. \n \nJamal added that the group has received over 600,000 orders for the T-shirts nationwide and is expected to sell 30,000 over this weekend. \n \n\u201cWe have over 5,000 shirts printed and ready to be sold. We have got overwhelming response with pre-orders reaching thousands coming in. We think we need to print more,\u201d he told reporters who had turned up to cover the Umno supreme council meeting. \n \nJamail said the earlier batch was sold out because of the outpouring of support from Malaysians to join the rally. \n \n\u201cThe orders keep coming in. Hope we can sell all by the time the rally happens. Now we have got itself over 600,000 nationwide from various groups who are helping to sell the T-shirt,\u201d he explained. \n \nMajor Razali Zakaria from another Malay movement called GMPN said his NGO had already ordered over 1,000 pieces of T-shirts ahead of the upcoming rally on September 16. \n \n\u201cA lot of my members have expressed interest to purchase this T-shirt. That\u2019s why I am here to buy them before they run out of stock,\u201d he told the Malay Mail Online when approached. Major Razali Zakaria (left) of GMPN says his group is buying 1,000 pieces of the T-shirts for the rally. \n \nThe September 16 rally had raised a storm after word of it spread on social media networks in recent days, but no one had owned up as its organiser till now. \n \nThe rally, which has also been called the \u201cDignity Association of Indonesia\u201d, has received unofficial support from some government officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob. \n \nIt is ostensibly in reaction to the Bersih 4 protest on August 29 and 30, and is touted to see a turnout of 300,000 supporters. \n \nBut not all of Umno is supportive of the September 16 rally. \n \nIt was criticised yesterday by former international trade and industry minister Tan Sri Rafidah Aziz, who dubbed it an instigation to racialisation with its call for Malays, especially those from the country\u2019s ruling party, to unite against the DAP and organisers of Bersih 4. \n \nPolice have prohibited the rally but Umno-linked newspaper Utusan Malaysia in its weekend edition last Sunday pressed the authorities to allow the rally to take place, saying it was necessary to counter what it dubbed as the Chinese-dominated Bersih 4 rally. \n \nElection watchdog Bersih 2.0 organised the street overnight on August 29 and 30 to demand for electoral reforms as well as the resignation of Datuk Seri Najib Razak as prime minister owing to a controversy surrounding his receipt of a RM2.6 billion donation from the Middle East. \n \nSeptember 16, which falls on a Wednesday, is Malaysia Day and a national holiday.","title":"Ahead of Sept 16 rally, red T-shirts promoting \u2018Malay dignity uprising\u2019 on sale outside PWTC","media-type":"News","source":"Malay Mail","published":"2015-09-09T10:04:40Z"}

In the study, thought to be the first to explore strategies to conquer what has become a serious public health concern, the research team worked with data from 38 previous intervention trials.\n\nSixty percent, or 23, of the trials appeared promising in relation to the remaining 39 percent, or 15.\n\nMore promising ideas included providing workers with sit-stand desks, encouraging people to keep track of how much time they spend sitting, setting personal goals for reducing sitting time and setting reminders to remind us to take a break.\n\nAll of these methods had proven themselves to be successful on their own and, what's more, none of them involve reminding people to exercise.\n\nOther effective methods included informing people of the health benefits that could arise from spending less time sitting.\n\n\"The importance of this study is not in showing that interventions can work, but in pointing out how they might work,\" says co-author Professor Stuart Biddle of Victoria University in Australia. \"This is crucial if behavior is to be achieved more efficiently and effectively.\"\n\nAfter wrapping up their research, the team recommends looking at sitting time as something independent of the need to exercise more.\n\nWhile they hope public health workers and policy makers will pick up on their findings, they advise individuals to start thinking this way now.\n\n\"...the findings should also be of interest to anyone looking to improve their health by reducing their own sitting time in their day-to-day lives, as many of these interventions can be adopted on an individual level,\" says co-author Dr. Benjamin Gardner of King's College London.\n\nPublished in the journal Health Psychology Review, the study supports another from earlier this year suggesting that regardless of regular exercise, prolonged sedentary periods still pose major health threats.\n\n\"Avoiding sedentary time and getting regular exercise are both important for improving your health and survival,\" said Dr. Alter, Senior Scientist, Toronto Rehab, University Health Network (UHN), and Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. \"It is not good enough to exercise for 30 minutes a day and be sedentary for 23 and half hours.\"\n\nWhile the meta-analysis concluded that those with high exercise quotients experience fewer of the consequences of sitting, exercise should not be viewed as a way to cancel out these negative effects.","title":"Sitting less a better goal than exercising more: study","media-type":"News","source":"Times Live South Africa","published":"2015-09-23T07:03:26Z"}

But let me make clear that we will only recommend consent if the accompanying fiscal framework is also fair to Scotland.\" \n\nThe SNP leader set out her programme for government just less than a year after Scots rejected independence in the referendum, opting instead to remain part of the UK. \n\nShe spoke about how she wanted to \" harness the passion and energy shown in the referendum, and use it to tackle the social and economic issues of our times\". \n\nMs Sturgeon said: \"The referendum debate also revealed a deep yearning for a fairer society, as well as a more prosperous economy. \n\n\"This ambitious and reforming programme for government speaks to those aspirations. It sets out how this government will work - now and in the long term - to achieve our vision for Scotland's future.\n\n\"It demonstrates how enduring values - a belief in enterprise, a faith in the value of education, a commitment to fairness and solidarity, and a passion for democratic engagement - can be applied to make Scotland a fairer and more prosperous country.\"\n\nWith Holyrood also due to get new powers over taxation, Ms Sturgeon confirmed Air Passenger Duty will be cut by 50% by the end of the next parliament, if the SNP wins next year's Holyrood elections.\n\nMinisters are consulting with business leaders and others on further tax powers, with the First Minister saying her Government would set out its intentions in the forthcoming Budget Bill.\n\nShe also said changes would be made to make Police Scotland more accountable.\n\nThe national police force has been hit by a number of controversies, with independent investigations under way in to the death in custody of Fife man Sheku Bayoh along with officers' failure to respond to reports of a fatal crash on the M9 in Stirlingshire. \n\nMs Sturgeon said there would be a review of police governance at national level, along with measures to improve the accountability and scrutiny of policing at a local level. \n\n\"For example, there will be a new requirement on the Chief Constable to attend local public scrutiny sessions,\" she said. \n\n\"A local scrutiny Summit to be held this month will identify further ways to enhance local accountability. And local scrutiny committees, together with members of the public and the parliament, will also have an important role to play in updating our national policing priorities.\" \n\nAny recommendations result from the review of police call handling will be implemented, Ms Sturgeon said, adding that a statutory code of practice on stop and search will also be introduced. \n\nOn housing Ms Sturgeon announced there would be an additional \u00a3195 million for the Help To Buy scheme, which assists those buying new build properties, over the next three years.\n\nTo help the rental sector, the Scottish Government will bring in a Private Tenancies Bill, which will include provisions for rent controls to be brought in in certain areas.\n\nNew systems of GP care will be trialled in at least 10 sites across Scotland over the next year, with the First Minister stating: \" We will support GPs to work in clusters and develop new ways of working with district nurses, health visitors, community rehabilitation teams and health improvement services, and using different services such as intermediate care beds.\" \n\nShe pledged \u00a3100 million of spending to improve mental health services, particularly for children and young people, and said work to integrate health and social care services should be complete by next April. \n\nThe First Minister said new legislation would be brought in to strengthen the law on domestic abuse, with the proposed Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm Bill also creating a new offence to tackle the problem of people sharing private pictures of former partners in so-called \"revenge porn\" cases.","title":"Nicola Sturgeon announces national testing for primary schools","media-type":"News","source":"Falkirk Herald","published":"2015-09-01T15:03:17Z"}

We are pleased to celebrate Leviton Network Solutions and eBay's Gold status and recognize their contribution to the structured cabling industry.\"\n\nSponsored by: As part of its data center technology roadmap, eBay planned to upgrade to 40GbE to its servers. In order to meet the requirements of the new design, it needed a cabling solution that would support extremely long multimode fiber runs \u2014 up to 500 meters in length \u2014 and allow migration to future bandwidth speeds of 100GbE and 400GbE. \n\nThe company tested the Leviton OM4+ Premium Violet Data Center fiber system with extended reach 40GBASE-XSR4 transceivers. While these transceivers have a manufacturer's stated maximum distance of 400 meters, the channel tested successfully beyond that length, with zero errors or dropped packets when transmitting over 500 meters. The testing subsequently led eBay to install the OM4+ system in four of its data centers. The system uses all OM4+ cabling and connectivity, including Leviton Opt-X Unity trunks, harnesses, array cords, and cassettes. \n\nTo learn more about Leviton OM4+ violet fiber cabling, visit leviton.com\/om4plus.\n\nAbout Cabling Installation & Maintenance \n\nPublished since 1993, Cabling Installation & Maintenance has provided practical information to professionals responsible for the specification, design, installation and management of structured cabling systems in enterprises, data centers and campuses.

Since its outbreak, the   conflict has destabilized most of Central Africa, including Congo\u2019s immediate neighbors   Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda. \n   \nQ Have there been any peacebuilding efforts? \n   \nCongo hosts the largest United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world, which  attempts to protect the Congolese population from various armed groups and maintain, or   enforce, a ceasefire. There are numerous donors, international organizations (such as the   African Union), and non-governmental agencies working in Congo, as well as plenty of   diplomats. All of these people organize international and national peace conferences, and   they try to help the Congolese state reform and train its army, modernize its bureaucracy,   and organize free and fair elections. \n   \nQ Why haven\u2019t those efforts worked? \n   \nViolence in Congo is in large part driven by local conflicts that international peace efforts   have not properly helped address. And by local, I really mean at the level of the   individual, the family, the clan, the municipality, the community, the district, and   sometimes the ethnic group. For instance, there is a lot of competition over who can be   chief of a village or a territory under traditional law, who can control the distribution of   land and the exploitation of local mining sites. This often results in localized fighting, and   can escalate across a whole province and even at times into neighboring countries. \n \nInternational peacebuilders view local conflicts as \u201csimply\u201d the result of national and   international tensions, insufficient state authority, and what they view as the Congolese   people's \u201cinherent penchant\u201d for violence. So they consider intervention at the national   and international levels as their only option. As a result, there is very little international   support for local conflict resolution efforts in Congo. \n   \nQ Is there an effective way to resolve conflict and build lasting peace? \n   \nBecause many conflicts have such local stakes, national and international peace   initiatives need to be supplemented with micro-level efforts. You cannot enact national   legislation or impose international law adjudicating who can be the appropriate chief of   each local village, or who among five parties in a conflict has legitimate ownership of a   piece of land. You need to look at these disputes on a case-by-base basis and find the   specific solution for each one. \n   \nQ Are there signs that give you hope for peace there? \n   \nCongolese elites and ordinary citizens have been engaged in bottom-up peace efforts   since the violence started more than 20 years ago, but they often lack the resources   required to be effective. Support from international donors can be crucial, and can lead to   the implementation of successful local peacebuilding initiatives. For instance, in the   provinces of the Kivus in eastern Congo, the Life and Peace Institute and its Congolese   partners have set up inter-community forums to discuss the specifics of local land   conflicts, and these forums have found solutions to help manage the violence. \n \nIn the past few years, an increasing number of donors, international agencies, and non-  governmental organizations have starting paying more attention to resolving land   conflicts and promoting inter-community reconciliation \u2013 two issues that are absolutely   key for bottom-up peace. So there is hope that this will lead to concrete action in support   of Congolese local peacebuilders. \n \nThis is the focus of my new research project, which examines how international   organizations can do a better job at supporting local actors and initiatives in   peacebuilding processes, particularly in Congo.","title":"5 Questions: Peacebuilding in Congo with Political Scientist S\u00e9verine Autesserre","media-type":"News","source":"Columbia University","published":"2015-09-16T16:02:14Z"}

She found a bulky bundle wrapped in black plastic. \n\nInside was roughly 26 pounds of marijuana \u2014 a package that authorities say was worth $10,000 and likely was dropped there accidentally by a drug smuggler's aircraft. \n\n\"It's all right on top of our dog's house,\" Donnelly said of the Sept. 8 incident, which was first reported by the Nogales International newspaper. \"It just made a perfectly round hole through our carport.\" \n\nLiving near the border, Donnelly said she assumed the object was drugs. She immediately called her husband, Bill, who told her to call 911. \n\nThe couple said officers who responded told them an ultralight aircraft smuggling marijuana from Mexico had probably let part of its load go early by accident before dropping the rest farther north, the newspaper reported. \n\nNogales Police Chief Derek Arnson said it's the first time in his three-year tenure that he's ever seen a load of drugs hit a building. \n\n\"Someone definitely made a mistake, and who knows what the outcome of that mistake might be for them,\" Arnson said. \n\nPolice are trying to determine whether the bundle was transported by an aircraft or a pilotless drone. Such runs usually occur at night. \n\nMaya Donnelly said she thinks it's unlikely someone will come looking for the drugs, which are now in police custody. Arnson agreed but said police have boosted patrols in the Donnellys neighborhood for now. \n \nThe family will have to pay the estimated $500 in repairs, as well as pay for a new home for their German Shepherd, Hulk. But the scenario could have been much worse for the couple and their three teenage daughters. \n\n\"Where it landed was clear on the other side of the house from the bedrooms,\" Maya Donnelly said. \"We were lucky in that sense.\" \n\nFriends and family also have gotten a laugh. Several joked that the couple could have profited from the surprise package. \n\n\"That's what everybody says: 'Why did you call 911?'\" Maya Donnelly said. \"But how can you have a clear conscience, right?

Firstly, Olympus will be updating both the E-M1 and E-M5 II mirrorless cameras in a couple of months, adding a raft of new features to both. And then we have Sony's plans for uncompressed raw support in the Alpha A7S II and A7R II mirrorless cameras , a plan that may possibly spread over time to bring other A7-series firmware updates. \n \nIn a typical week, that would be plenty enough for our Firmware Friday roundup, but even having already told you about all of that this week, we're still left with a whole lot to discuss. We have news of updates for two Canon DSLRs, two Nikon DSLRs, two business-oriented Ricoh rugged cameras and an action camera from Chinese brand XiaoYi. \n \nWe'll start with Canon, whose updates for the EOS-1D X and EOS-1D C DSLRs landed a couple of days ago. In both cases, the updates fix the exact same issue: The autofocus drive continuing to operate intermittently with a shutter button half-press, even when the custom functions had been set to activate metering only on a half-press. \n \nCanon EOS-1D X owners can download the firmware version 2.0.8 update from Canon's website and install it themselves. Canon EOS-1D C, owners, however, will have to return their camera to Canon to have the firmware version 1.4.0 update installed , and may have to pay for shipping and handling. \n \nNext up, we have Nikon's updates for the D5200 and D7100 DSLRs. Both updates aim to resolve a problem with camera lockup when the \"Clean image sensor\" function has been activated, as well as horizontal banding in HD (1,280 x 720 pixel) movies shot at 50p or 60p frame rates. \n \nFor the D7100 only, there are also fixes for a problem with camera lockups during menu scrolling in some languages, as well as an issue that caused the screen to darken during image review if the playback button was pressed. An unspecified problem with the viewfinder virtual horizon has also been corrected. \n \nYou can download Nikon's new firmware at the links below: \n \nNext up this week, we have new firmware for the Ricoh G800 and G800SE. These rugged cameras are aimed at business and industrial use, and differ in the latter's Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS and bar code scanning capabilities. (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are built-in, while the other functions require optional accessories.) \n \nNew firmware for the Ricoh G800SE and G800 resolves an issue with connection to PictBridge-compliant printers. For the G800, that's the only change, but the G800SE also gets some other tweaks. A problem that prevented image transfer when using the date folder option has been fixed, and support added for more 802.1x certificates. These include certificates that expire after the year 2038, chained certificates, and PEAP with EAP-MSCHAP v2 certificates (but only with an EAP-TLS certificate key of 2,048 bit or less.) \n \nYou can download Ricoh's new firmware at the links below: \n \nAnd finally, we come to the XiaoYi action camera, for which firmware version 1.2.12 landed earlier this week. Here, there have been tweaks to power-saving mode for greater battery life, and to sounds and status lights for better status indication. Behavior in time-lapse, burst mode and loop video recording has also been changed. Problems with app connectivity and live view have also been fixed, as well as issues with image reversal and clip length in time-lapse shooting. You can download the XiaoYi action camera firmware version 1.2.12 here . \n \nAnd that brings us to the end of a rather action-packed week on the firmware front.

We're very fortunate to have done that. \n \n\"We'll keep trying to get over the line and get that grand slam title.\" \n \nMahut and Herbert were slick around the net and more clinical when the opportunities arose, as one break at the end of each set was enough to seal victory in one hour and nine minutes. \n \n\"I am speechless now,\" Mahut said. \"We have been working so hard for so many years to win this kind of tournament. \n \n\"We lost in the final and I had another loss two years ago. We said today, 'let's go for it' and we played great. \n \n\"Pierre played great in the last game. I have never seen anyone play like that in a doubles match - unbelievable shots.\" \n \nMurray and Peers have played together for almost three years now and they raced out of the blocks, opening up three break points in the first game on Mahut's serve, but failed to capitalise. \n \nTwo more chances arrived for the British-Australian duo at 4-4 in the first set but again the French held on, as Peers missed a simple backhand volley. \n \nThe mistake perhaps preyed on Peers' mind as he then served a double fault at 5-4 before being broken to hand away the opening set. \n \nThe second was even tighter, as neither side offered up a single break point until the final game, when Herbert finished off a thrilling match point to secure victory and the title. \n \n\"It was pretty close,\" Murray said. \n \n\"Once you get there, you want to win, don't you? It's not like we are the best players ever that will be making finals every time we step on the court. \n \n\"Just you never know when you might not get back to one. So when you get back to one, obviously you want to win. It didn't happen.\" \n \nTheir success this year means Murray and Peers are already close to securing a place at the ATP World Tour Finals in London in November. \n \nMurray will now turn his attention to Friday's Davis Cup semi-final against Australia, where he is likely to partner Andy in the doubles as Britain bid to reach the final for the first time since 1978. \n \n\"It's good, I don't have time to sit around and dwell on the past,\" Murray said. \n \n\"I have to fly back tomorrow (Monday) night, get to Scotland and join up with the team and get back into the swing of things at Davis Cup. \n \n\"There's a lot to look forward to next week. We have got a great chance to try to get to the final. We're playing at home as well so lots to look forward to.\"","title":"Double woe for Jamie Murray after US Open final defeat","media-type":"News","source":"Bailiwick Express","published":"2015-09-13T11:53:48Z"}

The hiring event is offered by a consortium made up of four agencies: CareerTech for Vets (a program of the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education), the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission, the Oklahoma National Guard's Employment Coordination Program and the Oklahoma Department of Workforce Development. \n \nThose who are military members, Guard or Reserve, separating from active duty or veterans seeking employment, are encouraged to register for the event. Pre-registration with a resume will ensure exposure to employers to which they will be matched based on experience and skill set. Matched resumes have a greater success rate and are key to employer interviews. \n \nFifty employers from all over Oklahoma will be at the hiring event. Schools are not included, as the aim is to get vets and spouses into jobs with a livable wage. Walk-ins are welcome, but be sure to take your resume. \n \nSome employers will be conducting interviews on site, and computers are available for applicants who need to do some last-minute tweaking of their resumes or apply online. \n \nCol. Warren Griffis, director of the Oklahoma National Guard's Employment Coordination Program, said that in order to participate in the hiring event, employers must have current open vacancies and be willing to conduct interviews or a screening of some sort similar to an interview. \n \nThis is the third Oklahoma Military Connection hiring event that has been held in the Fort Sill Armed Forces Reserve Center. \n \n\"We've had outstanding success on the past two and expect even greater success this time,\" Griffis said. \n \nLast year's event drew upwards of 350 attendees. The employers who did report back said at least 13 people were hired from that event. \n \n\"It could be higher; we just haven't received information back from all employers. We believe the number is much higher,\" Griffis said.","title":"Hiring event scheduled at Sill on Friday","media-type":"News","source":"Lawton Constitution","published":"2015-09-20T12:29:27Z"}

With its clump of bubble-shaped rooms, the home seemed to spring out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon. \n\nGrey quickly realized, \u201cI just don\u2019t have another house that\u2019s like this. \n\n\u201d \n\nThat didn\u2019t make the property a white elephant, though. \n\nWhen Grey asked several real estate agents in the Bay Area whether there was a market for the unusual home, he recalled, \u201cThe consensus was there\u2019s constant demand. \n\n\u201d \n\nSure enough, a buyer snapped it up for $800,000. \n\nNearly two decades later, the quirky marvel \u2013 remodeled and enhanced \u2013 is on the market again, this time for $4.2 million. \n\nIt\u2019s one of several out-of-the-ordinary dwellings that have been making headlines lately. \n\nIn the Mojave Desert, a house shaped like a spaceship and set on the 150-foot cinder cone of an extinct volcano was listed at $650,000 earlier this month and went into escrow Friday. The property, on 60 acres with a lake, got multiple offers. In Beverly Hills, a sprawling compound touted as the priciest home in the U.S. last year just took a $46 million price cut. \n\nDespite their differences, houses like these raise a common question: How does anyone \u2013 real estate professionals, sellers or buyers \u2013 figure out what off-the-wall, over-the-top homes are worth? \n\nThe Volcano House was owned by TV personality Huell Howser, who gave it to Chapman University in 2012, a year before his death. The university had originally planned to use the house for desert studies, astronomy and geology pursuits. But it\u2019s selling the property because its desert location, in Newberry Springs east of Barstow, was deemed too isolated for students. \n\nBrady Sandahl of Hom Sotheby\u2019s International Realty says he and another agent listing the house considered other \u201carchitecturally significant\u201d properties, mostly in the high desert, in coming up with the $650,000 price tag. \n\n\u201cYou just develop a business gut as to what you think the market will capture,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you turn to the buyers, and they\u2019ll tell you why they\u2019re giving you what they\u2019re giving you. That\u2019s the beauty of an open market. \n\n\u201d \n\nSandahl said the multiple offers he received show the asking price was appropriate; three offers came in at $650,000 or more. \n\nBut clearly, the price tag would be higher if the property wasn\u2019t so remote. \n\n\u201cThis is real estate,\u201d said Grey, who appraised the Flintstone House. \u201cThe first three rules of real estate are location, location, location. \n\n\u201d \n\nThe Flintstone House is on the opposite side of that rule. It\u2019s 17 miles from San Francisco and right near I-280, a major freeway. \n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the yard of the Flintstone House,\u201d Grey said, \u201cyou hear that freeway very clearly. \n\n\u201d \n\nWhile the noise outside the home is a minus, on the plus side, Grey said, the house itself is nearly soundproof: \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a cave. \n\n\u201d \n\nHe attributes that to the construction. Steel rebar and wire mesh frames were built over large inflated weather balloons then covered with gunite, or \u201cshotcrete.\u201d He said that makes the walls thicker than a typical home\u2019s. \n\nAppraising even unusual homes involves the basics, Grey said. Size, number of rooms, quality of finishes and condition are all factors considered in addition to location. \n\n\u201cThose are relevant to any house, no matter how unusual or historical or plain it is,\u201d he said. \n\nTHE COMPS \n\nWith no truly comparable homes, Grey said, he used a bracketing system to determine where the Flintstone House fit on a spectrum. He placed the area\u2019s high-end Tudor homes and plain ranch homes at opposite ends. \n\n\u201cAppraising something \u2026 it\u2019s quite a bit more art than science,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of appraising that house, I put it right in the middle. \n\n\u201d \n\nHe did not make comparisons with unusual homes elsewhere in the country, he said. \n\nWith land value varying greatly, he explained, \u201cYou could be avoiding an adjustment regarding the design of the house and making a huge adjustment for the difference in location. \n\n\u201d \n\nIn Southern California, Realtors Joyce Rey and Stacy Gottula of Coldwell Banker Previews International cast a considerably wider net to come up with Palazzo di Amore\u2019s $195 million price tag, which has since dropped to $149 million. \n\nThe agents said they looked to the most expensive homes worldwide. \n\nThe 25-acre compound with its own vineyard in Beverly Hills was touted as the most expensive in the U.S. when it came on the market last year. \n\nThe gated, 12-bedroom, 23-bathroom property was eight years in the making. It\u2019s reached by a quarter-mile, tree-lined drive and has a guard station. A two-level entertainment center, with a 50-seat screening room and a bowling alley, is entered through a floating glass-floor walkway over pools lined by 70-year-old olive trees. \n\nThe main residence tops 35,000 square feet, while the entire estate has more than 53,000 square feet of living space. There\u2019s garage parking for 27 cars, though the site \u201ccan easily accommodate parking for (approximately) 150 cars,\u201d according to the listing. \n\n\u201cThere are so few comps, you really have to look at the history of sales in the area as well as the global sales,\u201d Gottula said. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be a global citizen of some kind,\u201d Rey said of the likely buyers. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have houses in various places, and they\u2019re going to be looking, in all probability, in all of those markets. \n\n\u201d \n\nThe Realtors considered the highest sales in London, Hong Kong, France and elsewhere.

Our members at each local were asked to participate in a strike authorization vote and overwhelmingly gave the International Union permission to call a strike when necessary. A strike is difficult and always the last resort when negotiations break down. We are not at that point. As you are aware, the current contract expired. We have agreed with the Company to extend the terms of the existing 2011 contract. This is not unusual and commonly occurs when either another company has been identified as the lead, as is the case here, or when a viable end is in sight and bargaining continues to progress. \n \nNumerous subcommittees have been negotiating specific aspects of the contract since July; most have reached tentative agreements. While we continue to meet on outstanding subcommittee issues, larger economic issues remain. \n \nEach round of negotiations presents its own unique challenges. We are determined to negotiate the best possible contract for our members while retaining good American jobs. \n \nWhile Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA US) is setting the pattern by negotiating first, we stand ready and able to complete our negotiations. As UAW President Dennis Williams and Vice President Norwood Jewell continue to bargain with FCA US, it is imperative that we, the UAW-Ford members, stand with our brothers and sisters at FCA US in solidarity and support. Our unity is our strength. \n \nMany entities against us are attempting to skew perception. I ask that you be cautious of the sources from which you receive your information and the material you choose to share. It is imperative that we are not misguided by rumors or misinformation. Again, unity is our strength. \n \nIn the midst of negotiating the future of the American autoworker, solidarity is needed now more than ever. We cannot run at the first sign of trouble, nor jump to conclusions at every speculation. We remain in solidarity with you, our retirees and our brothers and sisters at FCA US and General Motors, and encourage you to do the same. \n \nWe look forward to presenting a tentative agreement for ratification that meets the needs of our entire membership. \n \nIn Solidarity, \n \nJimmy Settles \nVice President and Director \nUAW Ford Department \n See the original letter  \n\u2013 \u2013 \n \n\u2014 \n\n\n\u00a9 Multimedia Investments Ltd Terms of Use\/Disclaimer.","title":"UAW-Ford VP Jimmy Settles Offers Negotiations Update","media-type":"News","source":"Foreign Affairs.co.nz","published":"2015-09-15T20:46:58Z"}

The hub will be constructed only a few kilometres from the Port of Tauranga\u2019s gates.\n\nThe move is somewhat of a \u201creturn of serve\u201d from the former in light of the latter having pioneered the inland port concept in New Zealand when establishing MetroPort Auckland 16 years ago.\n\nThe development, due to open in Triton Avenue towards the end of this year, will allow for wider competition and choice, said Ports of Auckland chief executive Tony Gibson.\n\n\u201cOur Bay of Plenty freight hub will help make New Zealand exporters more competitive on the world stage by making their access to global markets more efficient and easy,\u201d said Mr Gibson. \n\n\u201cIt also enables us to reduce excessive empty container movements and better balance the volume of exported goods with imported goods through our port.

As a White House fellow, it\u2019s your job to pick it up and bring it to him. Except when you get to the Oval Office, the door locks behind you. You can\u2019t get out until you figure out what\u2019s missing from the speech. What do you do? \n \nSo goes the scenario for Escape the Oval Office, one of two escape room-style games at D.C.\u2019s brand new Escape Lounge , which opened in July on H Street NE. With roots in video game culture, escape rooms are cropping up in cities across the country. Aptly named, they are essentially rooms that you have to escape by answering clues, solving riddles, or finding hints that lead you to the key. They\u2019ve become somewhat of a thing in the city in the past year, as WAMU noted last month , making the Escape Lounge the third to open since October. \n \nThis particular game lounge is also getting attention for having the city\u2019s first escape room game set in the White House\u2014though co-founder Ayanna Smith says that wasn\u2019t the original intention. Smith, her husband, and their business partner wanted to launch a family entertainment business and, upon learning about escape rooms, decided to start the kid-friendly 30-minute-long Escape the Classroom game. They opened Escape the Oval Office at the same time, though, and it quickly become the main attraction. \n \n\u201cThe Oval Office is a little more popular now, because of the D.C. theme,\u201d Smith says, adding that she\u2019s noticed it\u2019s an especially popular theme for tourists wanting to making their vacation as D.C.-centric as possible. \n \nEscape the Oval Office is a little bit different than some of the other escape rooms around town, which Smith warns visitors should know in advance. Rather than a linear style of play\u2014where Clue #1 takes you to Clue #2, and so on, down a numbered list of clues\u2014the Oval Office offers a lot of repeated clues in different locations around the office to help you find that missing piece from the president\u2019s speech. \n \nAt first, this was hard for Washingtonians to grasp. Rare was the team that actually completed the puzzle and escaped the room, which led to some serious frustration in the Escape Lounge\u2019s first weeks. Though Smith says that escape rooms \u201ctake a lot of pride in low escape numbers,\u201d she acknowledged that frustration, especially among the competitive types these games attract. So in the past month, the Escape Lounge has started ramping up the last-minute hints the staff offers players. Now, about 50 percent of players escape before the end of the hour-long Escape the Oval Office game. \n \nEven if you do escape, these rooms are designed to allow you to come back for more. Every few months or so, The Escape Lounge intends to change up the scenario of both Escape the Oval Office and Escape the Classroom\u2014keeping the themes, but changing the hints and the key needed to exit. \n \nBoth themed games are offered Wednesday to Sunday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; it's $25 per person. Smith says Escape the Oval Office books up quickly for its weekend sessions, so get a jump on those reservations. Each game is meant to be played with five to 10 people, so if your group is smaller you might find yourself escaping the room with strangers. Given the popularity these games have as team-building exercises, though, those strangers might be new friends by the time you get out. \n \nAmy McKeever is on the D.C. beat for Travel + Leisure .

Michelle Bachman, a pro-Israel shill who was later ridiculed for both her use of anti-depressants and her unflinching support for the international bankers who have deliberately sabotaged the American economy for more than a hundred years. \n \nThey loved her because she told them what they wanted to hear, and what she told them and what they wanted to hear was nothing but a garbled rant about American supremacy and the necessity to pay down the debt before any other money was ever spent. Some of us know now that the debt can never be paid off, which is the essence of the Jewish swindle of the whole world. \n \nHow could anybody with a brain have ever supported such a facile, drug-addled ignoramus as Bachman, who recently said the only way to avoid war with Iran is to bomb it? But it happens every election, with homicidal crazies urging war on the world to counter false flag threats that have been cynically engineered by the CIA and Mossad. Thanks to a war-mongering media run by the same money men who sell the weapons and commit the colossal crimes, Americans never learn. \n \nBut just as scary as the bizarre also-rans of history is the list of the people who have actually won presidential elections. Consider in recent years the immoral Bill Clinton, who gave America\u2019s jobs away; George Bush the Younger, who was so dim-witted he had to be left out of the plot to wreck the World Trade Center lest through his stupidity he accidentally revealed the secret Jewish plan; and Barack Obama, who has no verifiable history at all except a suspicious trail of dead homosexual friends and a wife with a male physiognomy. \n \nSo I guess we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised at the sudden emergence of megalomillionaire Donald Trump as the leader of this year\u2019s pack. He has done what other early leaders have always done, told people exactly what they want to hear. \n \nThe dark side of this autumn romance, however, is that he is exactly like all the other would-be tyrant candidates \u2014 a diehard supporter of Israel, a great believer in a strong military, and a solid supporter of all the financial chicanery that has mired America in its deteriorating economic quagmire. Perhaps Trump\u2019s expertise in the art of bankruptcy will provide a timely skill for the nation\u2019s current and deepening depression. \n \nBut all of these observations are incidental. The facts on the ground are that none of the current candidates shows any indication of tempering the criminal policies of U.S. aggression against Israel\u2019s enemies, or of addressing the intrinsically unfair policies of the Jewish central bankers who have fleeced America and the world since Woodrow Wilson promised to keep us out of World War I. \n \nAll the candidates show not a whit of genuine concern for the American people, but only obedience to the Jewish financial powers that make their candidacies possible. \n \nThen again, it seems to make a weird kind of sense that the candidates don\u2019t display any verifiable competence and the electorate is predominantly out to lunch. It\u2019s a perfect match. Fake leaders for fake people. From this match made in hell, nothing but further catastrophe can result. \n \n\u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \nYour life is a lie, and the lives of your children are lies, based upon what you have told them about the way the world works, and how their futures will unfold. \n \nYou based your life on the lies you learned from your parents, received in school, and gleaned from the media and your friends, who have all been immersed in a sea of misinformation throughout their lives. \n \nBut now the grim fairy tales you have erected to justify your exploitation of the less fortunate of the world are beginning to crumble. The word bounceback has never been more apropos. The law of karma inflicts its deadly reward in the mirrored reflex of savages mimicking the heartless interlopers who have plundered them, desperate savages who now overwhelm the countries that have exploited them in the past. \n \nAnything goes, and money is all that matters. And on that day when the money is worth nothing, the world will implode. \n \nAnything that can be saved can also be stolen, as today\u2019s Europeans are learning at their peril. \n \nEurope and America are about to be overrun by hungry slaves. Nothing can stop them, especially since the government is helping displace its own loyal citizens in a plot too wrenchingly macabre to even begin to comprehend. \n \nHow does it come to be that many of the refugees subjecting themselves to hardship and fleeing their war-torn homelands have thousands of dollars in their pockets, money which supposedly comes from American sources? How were these refugees able to pay the thousands of dollars for their precarious sea voyages from Turkey to some forlorn Mediterranean shore. \n \nPrecious few of us are strong enough, at least when we\u2019re young, to discern between the truth and the lie, between the stark unadorned reality that nonplusses us and the fanciful fairy tale that beguiles us. More importantly, the young fail to realize that what we do to others inevitably comes back to haunt us. \n \nSo we get our news from the newspapers, or today the TV news, which, rather than being purveyors of the actual facts of the world, are rather the curators of the perpetual lies of the world, and in our reading of the news we become like those who have manipulated us always wanted us to become, namely, heartless killers, interested only in our own prospective fortunes. \n \nForced to defend our lives and our property, we will fight. And the Jews will have won, deploying their police to quell the unreasonable unrest. \n \nThe financial engine of the United States runs on killing people every day, which our candidates conveniently ignore as they prattle on about national security and the need to pay down a national debt that can never be repaid. \n \nWe have been taught to believe so many false things put forth by our fake media that we can\u2019t hope to even discern what a genuinely altruistic candidate would actually say. We have been so convinced of the necessity of the income tax and the inevitability of inflation that we can no longer grasp the reality that existed in America for more than a hundred years that neither of these parasitic practices existed, and for a century inflation did not occur. \n \nWe listen to our doctors and the people in control of our children who swear on a stack of Bibles that what they\u2019re doing is best for us, then react in tearful silence as our kids are returned to us at the end of the school day either half dead or totally deformed because of the medicines they were forced to take or the appalling lessons they were compelled to learn (like showing homosexual techniques to first graders to properly prepare them for molestation). \n \nThe one essential gauge that will indicate America is on the road to realism will be that one landmark day when we finally decided to address the festering lie of the 9\/11 coverup. Until that happens we will continue on the road to ruin until America and the human race will run out of time, which will happen when we run out of air, which will happen a lot sooner than everyone thinks. \n \nFrom here on out, no person who refuses to address and overturn the lies that were told on September 11, 2001 can ever be a legitimate president of the United States. All those running now are merely cardboard cutouts furnished by the kosher tyrants who control our lives. They are all guaranteed to do nothing to improve our lives, only to fleece us thoroughly before harvesting our organs. \n \nThe savage rabble that now overruns the so-called civilized world only delivers the required cosmic payment for the mutilation of their innocence, the rape of their cultures, and theft of their precious possessions. They are here to return the favors. \n \nIn a country that ignores hapless victims of gratuitous violence lying in the street bleeding, one should not expect a functional response to one\u2019s own misery and pain. That no candidate can realistically promise relief from our misery further indicates that whatever our presidential hopefuls are saying is merely meaningless rhetoric from the insane asylum our society has become. \n \nDonald Trump is a specialist in bankruptcy and casinos, which tells us a lot about the future he would guide us toward. Owner of golf courses and beauty contests, his television show featured his ability to fire people in an insulting way. The bottom line is that he has even been fired as boss of his own casinos and the people who invested in those casinos have lost 99 percent of their investments, according to CNN. \n \nI think it\u2019s a fair rule of thumb that to vote for Donald Trump \u2014 or for that matter any of the announced candidates \u2014 that you will lose 99 percent of your investment. \n \nAnother loser trying to end her unemployment with a stint in the White House is Carly Fiorina, who was fired as president of Hewlett Packard after being labeled as one of the worst technology CEOs of all time. \n \nThen there\u2019s Ben Carson, the vaunted neurosurgeon who advocates forced vaccinations despite the poisons in them. I\u2019d mention the other Republican candidates but you could do better picking names at random out of the pages of a big city telephone book. \n \nAgainst this lineup of moribund Republicans, the Democrats counter with Bernie Sanders, an acknowledged Communist, and the old hag Hillary Clinton, who like so many other current American politicians, admittedly most of them Democrats, really ought to be serving life in prison for treason. \n \nEvery one of these brittle personas have their own quaint fairy tales about what is wrong with the U.S. government, but like the people whose votes they pursue, they all fail to understand the words of the philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti, who once said: \n \nIt is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. \n \nTo cast your vote for any one of these announced candidates is to reveal your own blind psychopathology for all to see, assuming there is anybody left who actually can see in this fetid swamp of fake people known as the American populace. \n \nJohn Kaminski is a writer who lives on the Gulf Coast of Florida, constantly trying to figure out why we are destroying ourselves, and pinpointing a corrupt belief system as the engine of our demise.

A weekly Central Bank survey of 100 economists on Tuesday said that further raising the rate would not help Brazil's steep economic slowdown.\n\nThe bank said the decision Wednesday by its monetary policy committee was unanimous.\n\nThe panel based its decision on an analysis of Brazil's macroeconomic situation, prospects for inflation and its current risk outlook, the bank said.\n\nThe world's seventh biggest economy is in a recession predicted to extend through 2016 and previous rate rises have not prevented a steady rise in inflation to the current 12-year high of 9.56 percent.\n\nThe 14.25 percent interest rate is already one of the highest in big economies.\n\nAnalysts believe the high interest rate will gradually bring down price rises, but that a new hike could be risky.\n\nThe real has lost more than a quarter of its value against the US dollar this year and there are fears for Brazil's investment grade credit rating after the government on Monday presented a 2016 budget that for the first time projects operating in the red.\n\nIn addition to the macroeconomic troubles, Brazil is being shaken by a political crisis with President Dilma Rousseff facing calls for her impeachment.","title":"Brazil's central bank keeps key interest rate at 14.25%","media-type":"News","source":"Yahoo!

Blue chip miners share prices plummeted as soon as the Australian market opened after a horror night for resources stocks on the London exchange, as analysts warn it is particularly vulnerable to China's slowing growth and prices slump. In early trade, BHP Billiton shares are down 3 per cent to $23.12 and Rio Tinto 2 per cent to $48.24.\n\nThe losses continue the declining trend this year in line with commodity prices. Rio Tinto has lost 14.9 per cent and BHP 22.7 per cent since January, and 5 per cent this month alone.\n\nThe decline could see BHP tumble below the year-low of $22.84 reached in August. A fall below this price would see it reach a new seven-year low.\n\nOvernight, BHP Billiton lost 5.1 per cent and Rio Tinto fell 3.2 per cent in London.\n\nThe falls come amid as global markets face the inevitable slowdown of the Chinese economy and its demand for industrial metals. On Tuesday the Asian Development Bank lowered its growth expectations for China.\n\nRatings agency Moody's described the resources sector as the most exposed to China's slowing growth, a call underscored by Credit Suisse, which cut its Chinese forecasts for demand.\n\n\"Much of this is a catch-up to current conditions, which remain highly uncertain, but until China demand and emerging market currencies find a floor, it will remain challenging to put an absolute floor on commodity prices,\" Credit Suisse research analyst Liam Fitzpatrick told The Financial Times.\n\nIn June, RBC Capital revised its ratings for BHP Billiton to underperform but maintained Rio Tinto at \"neutral\" and South32 at \"outperform\". South32 dropped 1.2 per cent on the London exchange over night.\n\nAt the time, EIM Capital's John Robertson warned BHP's had long been overvalued and that he expected it to continue to fall.\n\n\"BHP's value proposition has always been overestimated. It was in almost every fund, individual and institutional, and this demand saved it from the reckoning when the sector repriced, but now its day has come,\" Mr Robertson said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the company announced an upcoming vote that could see Australian shareholders sacrifice some of the company's franking credits to ensure it can meet its dividend requirements to UK shareholders.

Thompson wants a three-year, $53 million max contract or a five-year deal for $94 million. \n\nThe 24-year-old Thompson averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds during the 2014-15 regular season when he was the Cavs' sixth man. After Kevin Love was injured in the first round of the playoffs, Thompson started at power forward. In the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, he averaged 11.6 points and 12.6 rebounds. \n\nCavs star LeBron James was asked about Thompson's situation at the team's media day. \n\n\"As the leader of this team, I understand how important Tristan is to this team,\" James said Monday. \"I think we all saw what he's able to do in the postseason, and not only the postseason but all throughout. ...

U.S. stocks were poised for a solid opening with Dow futures and the broader S&P 500 futures up 0.5 percent. \n\nSOUR COCKTAIL: Over recent days, worries over China have resurfaced, not least in the impact the slowdown in the world's number 2 is having on commodity prices, many of which have fallen to multiyear lows. On Monday, commodities group Glencore saw its share price tank by around a third amid concerns over its ability to service its debts if commodity prices don't rise. The fallout from Volkswagen's emissions rigging scandal also remains with investors unsure of the impact on the industry. Fed officials, meanwhile, continue to signal they will raise U.S. interest rates this year, marking the beginning of the end of ultra-low interest rates that have underpinned stock markets. \n\nANALYST TAKE: \"At the risk of saying 'It's that time of year,' bearing in mind the timing of historical equity market crashes in September or October, there is no doubt that a confluence of events is unsettling investors,\" said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital. \n\nGLENCORE BOUNCE: One of the reasons why the market mood has improved is that Glencore has seen its share price bounce back 6 percent from Monday's hammering. On Tuesday, analysts at Citibank said the fall in Glencore's share price \u2014 about 80 percent from its high in May \u2014 has been \"overdone\" and suggested the company could raise more money from the sale of investments than the $2 billion it has penciled in. Citibank analysts also said Glencore management could consider taking the company back into private hands. \n\nASIA'S DAY: The calmer backdrop in Europe was not anticipated after the earlier rout in Asia, which followed Monday's big down day on Wall Street. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped 4.1 percent to 16,930.84 while Australia's S&P\/ASX 200 declined 3.8 percent to 4,918.40.

With a fifth of young people currently out of work in Europe and rates as high as over 50% in Greece, Spain and Italy, youth unemployment is the most pressing challenge facing young people today, and improving the lives and prospects of the young is increasingly high on the agenda for the European Parliament and Commission. It is with this goal in mind that a 45-strong group of 18-25 year olds from the UK, Finland and Greece were invited to Brussels on Tuesday 15 September. \n\nBut this was not an occasion for European policymakers simply to congratulate themselves on their successes thus far, or to provide lectures on the core initiatives aimed at improving young people's lives and job prospects. Central to our aims was to hear the first-hand experience of young people from three countries, each with very different struggles and successes: presentations on long-term youth unemployment, precarious work and youth entrepreneurship, led by Greece, the UK and Finland respectively, formed the backbone of our afternoon's discussions, providing much needed clarity to the challenges that lie ahead. \n\nWhile youth unemployment is relatively stable and in general only temporary in Finland - hailed as the beacon for the implementation of the now Europe-wide Youth Guarantee - the UK government continues to refuse to implement a British equivalent, despite calls to the contrary from the European Commission, House of Lords , trade unions and civil society organisations. Yet under 25s in the UK are now more than three times more likely to be out of work than older generations, with more than a third subjected to the now infamous 'zero-hours' contracts plighting the lives of so many struggling to make ends meet. And the desperate situation facing young Greeks, as their country attempts to rebuild from the rubble of an ongoing economic crisis, is by now a familiar tale. The young in Greece have been the most adversely affected by the economic crisis in Europe: youth unemployment was at 50.1% in January this year, while one third of Greek youths are out of work for more than a year. It was a great privilege to be able to bring together young people from these three corners of today's EU, and to hear the lived experience behind the statistics. \n\nClearly our work is far from done, however unfortunately it is an all-too rare sight to witness a discussion between a large group of young Europeans and experts from the Commission, European Parliament, trade unions and pan-European youth organisations. So much of European legislation has a top-down approach that fails to involve the very people whose lives it will affect. This is no more so the case than when it comes to the young. \n\nWe want this to change, and will turn our words into actions: as such, the views of our young participants will be collated into a report that will be submitted to the Parliamentary committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the European Commission. As MEP for the region worst affected by youth unemployment in the country , I consider it my responsibility to make sure these voices are heard by the people that can make a real difference: last Tuesday was simply the start of that process. \n\n\nJude Kirton-Darling is Labour MEP for the North East of England","title":"Jude Kirton-Darling:  Putting the Young at the Heart of Policymaking Is the Key to Tackling Youth Unemployment","media-type":"News","source":"Huffington Post UK","published":"2015-09-21T12:17:25Z"}

Coupled with other data, it shows that the Chinese authorities have been intervening to support the yuan as capital outflow continues,\" said Shin Kadota, chief FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nOn Monday, Malaysia's ringgit plumbed fresh 17-year lows while the South African rand slipped to a record low, both under pressure because of relatively limited foreign currency reserves. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nWith U.S. financial markets shut for holiday on Monday, the dollar moved little against major currencies. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nThe dollar index stood at 96.206, little changed from late last week. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nAgainst the yen, the dollar ticked up slightly to 119.45 yen , still half-way in recovering its losses on Friday. The euro stood little changed at $1.1159. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nOil prices fell more than 3 percent on Monday, as the fall in Chinese share prices and record North Sea crude production added to global supply concerns. \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r \nBrent crude futures rose 0.9 percent to $48.02 after a 3.7 percent fall on Monday.

The daily exchange rate has suddenly become my obsession. With every euro cent we plunge, I'm thinking: goodbye good times. \n \nIf it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, or even just the best experience available, go for it, and spend modestly on something else. \n  \nBut of course that is ridiculous. It's possible to have \"champagne wishes and caviar dreams\" (to quote a popular 1980s TV show) when the dollar buys less than 48 pence or US65\u00a2. \n\nThe first thing that needs to be rebooted is the concept of luxury. \n\nI'm always suspicious of the word 'luxury'. Often it's just a description of a bland, mediocre service that has a few frills more than basic. True luxury might be about many other things, according to personal taste - privacy, tranquillity or enriching experiences, perhaps. The dollar value on it is becoming increasingly irrelevant. \n\nThe word is becoming irrelevant and meaningless too. \n\nOne man's luxury might be gold taps and a plethora of cushions and obsequious service. Another's might be downtime in a beautiful, remote location where you can go off the grid. Still another might be a resort or cruise where you can leave the children in the hands of others. Or sleeping in a villa with an amazing history. \n\nThe most \"luxurious\" hotel suite I've ever seen didn't have a whisper of gold or any hint of dazzle \u2013 it was exquisitely simple, created by one of the world's most notable designers. Luxury can be what is not as much as what there is. Simplicity can be as costly as ornamentation. \n\nDegrees of opulence never determined luxury for me. Often I'm more impressed with the small details, like pure cotton pyjamas provided at a Vietnamese resort, or a bath filled with rose petals in Bali. \n\nThe greatest luxury for me in travel, what gives me my biggest kicks, is not wallowing in a bed with millions of pillows or sitting up the front of a plane, it is making friends with strangers, spending time with the great characters that populate our world, the thrill of discovering differences but also fellow feeling in the way we all look at the world. \n\nLeisure travel is luxury. We are fortunate to be able to do it. \n\nTravelling thriftily for me is not about cutting corners but about enhancing the experience and not giving in to false economies. I've learnt over the years by the mistakes of made, such as denying myself the restaurant where I'd really like to dine in favour of a cheaper one, and finding that, in the run of things, that extra $100 hasn't mattered one bit. \n\nIf you wish it, small luxuries are perfectly possible at any time. Siphon off a day or two for a splurge on a pricey hotel or set aside funds for a lavish night out. Divert to a less expensive city, like Budapest, which is as opulent as Paris or London. You can have a little bit of luxury every day if you play your cards right. \n\nSomeone once gave me some very good advice \u2013 travel with an evening gown or something dressy, because you never know who you might meet and where you'll be invited. So I always travel as if that invitation to someone's palace or villa is just around the corner. And if it isn't, I make my own glamour. \n\nCocktails may cost upwards of 25 euro ($40)\u00a0in the bars of some of Europe's luxury hotels, but you can nurse one for hours. The bar somewhere classy like Le Meurice in Paris is fascinating, full of diplomats, celebs and eccentrics. Even if you're staying somewhere that's nowhere near as salubrious, no one need know. You'll remember the night you lived it up at a swank hotel. \n\nSimilarly, if you're dressed for it, the sales assistants of the world's expensive boutiques will let you play with their clothes and shoes for hours and you don't have to buy a thing. \n\nIf it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, or even just the best experience available, go for it, and spend modestly on something else. The nickels and dimes don't matter. It's the memories that count.","title":"Luxury holidays with a low Australian dollar: Why you don't have to give up on luxury","media-type":"News","source":"WA Today","published":"2015-09-18T14:28:51Z"}

New Australia captain Steve Smith will look back on the 2013-14 Ashes series as the clearest and greatest example of Brad Haddin's positive impact on the Australian team.

He was magnificent at that, and I think a lot of keepers around the world can learn from the way he played.\"\n\nSmith also hailed Haddin as \"certainly one of the best team men I've ever been around ... always put the team first in every aspect\".\n\nCoach Lehmann, who first played against Haddin almost 15 years ago when the wicketkeeper was just 22, said Haddin was not only a fantastic player but also \"a fantastic mentor for a lot of young players [and] a great mentor for me as coach\".\n\n\"He's a fantastic human being and he'll be welcome in our change rooms all the time, because he's an absolute superstar,\" said Lehmann, who was part of the selection panel that excluded Haddin for the second half of the just-completed Ashes series.\n\n\"He made some crucial runs for us in Ashes series, and in different series all round in all formats. For us, his keeping was exceptional, his batting was very good. It was a case of him being able to turn a game very quickly for you. That's what [Adam] Gilchrist did exceptionally well as well.\"\n\nLehmann said Haddin would leave a vast and diverse legacy: \"The baggy green, the way he wore it with pride. The way he helped younger players. The way he helped drive the team as a whole. The way he helped coaches. The way he helped mould the team. The way we play today is an exceptional legacy for him. The way he thought about his family and helped his family through difficult times, and the way he helps other people's family and friends,\" he said.

{"id":"f71b89ee-ebbc-4da9-a245-dd3a6dbcadf8","content":"(Bloomberg) -- European government bonds surged, pushing German five-year yields below zero for the first time in almost a month, as a slide in equity markets boosted demand for fixed- income assets. \n\nBenchmark German 10-year bunds led gains as European stocks fell the most in more than two weeks, underpinning the region\u2019s benchmark sovereign securities. Speculation of extended stimulus from the European Central Bank increased after Executive Board member Peter Praet said on Monday that policy makers would \u201cforcefully react\u201d to defend their inflation objective. Since the ECB started its 1.1 trillion-euro ($1.2 trillion) bond- buying program in March, inflation in the currency bloc has slowed to a near standstill, compared with the ECB\u2019s goal of just below 2 percent. \n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to refrain from increasing interest rates last week has bolstered the prospect of the ECB extending its \u201ceasy-monetary policy stance,\u201d according to Rabobank International. \n\n\u201cWe are seeing softness in European equities and that provides a conducive backdrop for fixed income,\u201d said Richard McGuire, head of European rates strategy at Rabobank in London. He added that \u201congoing speculation of additional central-bank support in Europe and beyond, in the wake of the Fed\u2019s steady rate decision, may be also playing a part here.\u201d \n\nGermany\u2019s five-year note yields declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to minus 0.015 percent at 3:15 p.m. London time. That\u2019s the first time the yield has fallen below zero since Aug. 25. The 0.25 percent security due October 2020 climbed 0.285, or 2.85 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.34. The nation\u2019s 10-year bund yield dropped eight basis points to 0.61 percent. \n\nSimilar-maturity French bond yields fell seven basis points to 0.99 percent, and those on Italy\u2019s declined five basis points to 1.76 percent. \n\nDutch Auction \n\nThe Netherlands sold 2.8 billion euros of three-year debt at a record-low yield. The Dutch State Treasury Agency allotted the notes due in April 2018 at an average yield of minus 0.156 percent, down from minus 0.032 percent at a previous auction on June 9. Yields on Dutch two-year notes fell to a record low of minus 0.246 percent. \n\nA negative yield means investors buying the securities now will get back less\u00a0if they hold them until maturity than they paid. \n\nThe primary focus for European bond markets will be economic data, according to Luca Cazzulani, senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan. \n\n\u201cRight now we have to look at the data because that will tell you where the momentum is going,\u201d Cazzulani said. \u201cThe ECB is saying they will intervene and do more if needed and that ultimately depends on the data.\u201d \n\nAnalysts said a report on Wednesday will show that a gauge of euro-area manufacturing growth slowed this month. Markit Economics\u2019 Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index fell to 52 from 52.3 in August,\u00a0according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. That would be the lowest reading since April.","title":"Germany\u2019s Five-Year Yields Drop Below Zero as Equities Tumble","media-type":"News","source":"La Repubblica","published":"2015-09-22T14:47:33Z"}

{"id":"5e7a035e-3a52-4133-afb7-564423d6b1b0","content":"Stu Waring's bike-fitting area in the back of Parvilla Cycle & Multisport could be confused with a doctor's office or a physical therapy center. \n\nThere's a skeleton. There's a foldup massage table. And then there's Waring, guiding his clients through an array of movements while discussing the health of their body. \n\nBut Waring isn't a doctor or a physical therapist. He's a bike fitter, who adjusts bikes by discovering riders' best possible position on the cycle for comfort and speed. \n\nIt's Waring and this back area that has made Parvilla Cycle & Multisport a premier bike shop on the East Coast. After just four years in operation, the store has been ranked one of the top 50 bike shops in the country by Active Times and was one of six nominated for best pro road shop in the nation by Interbike Awards. \n\n\"This is the store,\" said Waring, who started the shop with Iain Banks. \"Fitting is our store and why we are doing as well as we are four years into a brand-new business.\" \n\nWhile the store has garnered a strong local presence for its bikes and accessories, riders from around the country flock to the shop to get a fitting. Waring and his colleagues said he is typically booked about four weeks in advance for his fittings. \n\nHe does one fitting a day Monday through Friday. Each one takes about four hours and costs $350 for the standard package and $500 for the premium. \n\n\"1\/8Waring's3\/8 one of the best fitters on the East Coast, so that brings in a broader range of customers,\" service manager Joseph Sikorski said. \n\nBike fitting wasn't Waring's first job, though. He got his degree in naval architecture and spent about 20 years in the industry, but he later got his fitting education through Retul, which is based in Boulder, Colo. \n\nHe has since become an instructor for the company and is its only fitter on the East Coast. Waring brings his engineering background to help his understanding of bikes, but he also enjoys studying the body and said he has picked up on things from chiropractors and physical therapists. \n\nIt's Waring's blend of the two aspects that allows him to best suit his clients. He can tell when customers need to correct their back problems, but rather than do it himself, he recommends them to a specialist and then has them come back once they are healthy. \n\n\"There are fitters out there that will make the computer look good,\" Waring said. \"They'll work the numbers and do all kinds of stuff and it looks good on the screen, but they get out there and they are jacked. The problem is it's the hips or the knees. They don't know enough or care enough about the body.\" \n\nThat's where Waring looks to set himself apart. And once he has a healthy client, he is able to turn to his machinery and knowledge to help improve a person's position on a bike. \n\nSituated in the back room, Waring has a \"Guru Dynamic Fit Unit,\" which amounts to being a machine bike that is adjustable. Waring said he has used it roughly 2,000 times and credits it for generating about $350,000 a year, thus deeming it his \"printing press.\" \n\nSurrounded by TV monitors, the machine allows Waring to adjust his client's position on the bike while still riding instead of having to manually change the bike over and over until the correct spot is found. \n\nHis background and equipment recently helped get an individual with cancer in his neck into a position where he can ride. He was previously having trouble looking up because of his limited mobility, but his position has changed that and he asked Waring whether he could go for a ride to coach him. \n\nWaring doesn't coach anymore, but instead, he plans on just enjoying a nice day with him. \n\n\"We are just going to go and have a coffee and have a ride some time,\" Waring said. \"I get a kick out of that. That, to me, is what it's all about.\" \n\nIt's that family attitude, beyond just the fitting, that has helped build the store, the employees said. \n\nBanks' wife, Sarah, who co-owns the store with Waring, said it comes down to knowing customers' names and chatting with them when they stop by. \n\n\"We are able to cater to everyone at the same time, whether it is someone getting into it or someone that wants a $20,000 bike,\" Sikorski said. \"We treat everyone the same. We are small group of people. We are like a family.\" \n\nThe store holds weekly rides that allow it to not only grow a customer base, but also build a community around the store. On Mondays, it offers about a 20-mile co-ed bike ride that leaves from the store. Then Wednesdays, it has a ladies-only ride followed by a barbecue. \n\n\"It brings more people to the area,\" Sikorski said. \"It's a friendly atmosphere, just everyone hanging out having a hot dog and a beer.\" \n\nBanks said he and Waring set out to make the business something different to separate it from other independent bike stores. Waring and his bike fitting has done that for Parvilla. \n\nBut there is more to the store than just that back room. Bikes line the wall, helmets rest on shelves, and now there's also triathlon equipment. \n\nThe bike fitting might be the main revenue stream and what draws outsiders in, but Parvilla Cycle & Multisport prides itself on everything else it offers the community, too. \n\n\"As much as we still do the high-end, custom, niche items, we are still that neighborhood bike store as well,\" Banks said. \"We will still work on everybody's bike.\"","title":"Baltimore bike shop setting itself apart, earning national acclaim","media-type":"News","source":"Wichita Eagle","published":"2015-09-24T08:00:00Z"}

The 6-foot-4, 220-pound quarterback rushed for 68 yards on eight carries, including a 42-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. \n\nSophomore Justin Jackson rushed the ball 28 times for 134 yards to lead the Wildcats, while Stanford starting running back Christian McCaffery carried 12 times for 66 yards and fumbled once. \n\nSenior Christian Jones, who missed last season with a knee injury, caught five passes for 52 yards to lead Northwestern receivers. \n\nGeorgia 51, Louisiana-Monroe 14 \n\nATHENS, Ga. -- Although the ninth-ranked Bulldogs weren't perfect and mistakes were made, they simply had too much offensive firepower and used it to roll over the Warhawks. \n\nGeorgia sophomore Heisman Trophy candidate Nick Chubb picked up where he left of, rushing 16 times for 120 yards and two touchdowns while Greyson Lambert made his debut as the Bulldogs' starting quarterback and completed 8 of 12 passes for 144 yards and two scores, including one each to Malcolm Mitchell and Jeb Blazevich. \n\nKeith Marshall also enjoyed a big day. After playing in just three games last year after tearing his ACL in 2013 against Tennessee, Marshall rushed 10 times for 73 yards with two touchdowns. \n\nOle Miss 76, UT-Marin 3 \n\nOXFORD, Miss. -- Chad Kelly threw two touchdowns in the first half and the No. 17 Rebels rolled to a convincing win. \n\nKelly dazzled the crowd of 60,186 fans at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium from the start, completing pass after pass to a wide array of weapons at his disposal. Kelly, the nephew of NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly, completed his first touchdown pass to Markell Pack. It covered 56 yards, with the majority of it coming through the air down the middle of the field. Kelly finished the first half 6-for-10 for 178 yards and he made up for an interception he threw in the third by running for a score a few minutes later. \n\nKelly wasn't the only Rebel skill player who shined Saturday. Running back Jaylon Walton scored the first two times he touched the ball, while wide receiver Laquon Treadwell returned from a season-ending injury in 2014 in seamless fashion. \n\nClemson 49, Wofford 10 \n\nCLEMSON, S.C. -- Sophomore Deshaun Watson, playing in his first game since suffering a torn ACL last November, got off to a solid start, completing 18 of 22 passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns in limited duty as the No. 12 Tigers rolled past Wofford. \n\nWhile Watson appeared completely healed from ACL surgery last December, the Tigers' post-game concern focused on the health of junior wide receiver Mike Williams. He snagged a 4-yard touchdown pass from Watson to cap Clemson's game-opening drive, but suffered a neck injury on the play when he collided with the goalpost support. Williams remained on the ground for approximately 15 minutes before being placed on a stretcher and carted off the field. \n\nWilliams, who led Clemson with 1,030 receiving yards last season, raised his right arm as he left the field, but was hastened to a nearby hospital for evaluation.","title":"Top 25 roundup: Northwestern upsets No. 21 Stanford","media-type":"News","source":"WYFF4.com","published":"2015-09-05T20:58:30Z"}

Photo by Joe Murphy \n   \nThe Memphis Tigers men\u2019s soccer team knew they were in for a challenge in Friday night\u2019s season opener against UAB, so while the 3-1 loss wasn\u2019t what the Tigers hoped for it wasn\u2019t any cause for concern either. \n \nThat may have changed a little bit Monday afternoon following Memphis\u2019 1-0 loss at home to Northern Kentucky, who finished 6-10-4 against a relatively weak schedule a season ago. The loss gives Memphis an 0-2 record on the young season, and with three road games against difficult teams coming up next on the schedule the Tigers will have to figure things out sooner rather than later. \n \nPerhaps the most notable issue with the Tigers in the early goings of the season has been the team\u2019s finishing ability, or lack thereof. In both losses Memphis has out-shot their opponents \u2014 21-8 vs. UAB and 13-9 against Northern Kentucky. However, of those 34 shots only one has resulted in a goal.\u00a0 \n \n\u201cThe quality in the final third again for the second straight game wasn\u2019t there, and I think to correct that you just get on the practice field and work on crossing and finishing, as basic as that is,\u201d head coach Richard Mulrooney said about the team\u2019s finishing in the first two games. \u201cWe are creating the opportunities. It\u2019s just a matter of finally putting the ball in the back of the net.\u201d \n \nDespite scoring only one goal in two games, Memphis\u2019 offense has actually been pretty solid. The Tigers are controlling possession for stretches and are able to set up goal-scoring opportunities. Once the U of M is able to actually finish those opportunities they should be fine, but until that happens they\u2019re going to need spectacular performances from the defense to have a shot at winning games. \n \nMuch like the offense, the defense has been doing its job outside of one glaring weakness \u2014 set pieces. Of the four goals given up by the Memphis defense, three have come as a direct result of a corner or free kick.\u00a0 \n \nIn the opener, the Tigers were tied 1-1 with UAB until the Blazers scored twice in two minutes off of two set pieces. Set piece offense is something of a specialty for the Blazers \u2014 Mulrooney likened it to the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors and three-point shooting \u2014 but then Monday afternoon the Blue and Gray found themselves victims of a set play score yet again when Northern Kentucky\u2019s Calvin Murphy headed in a free kick in the 64th minute for the game-winner, signaling that it could be a problem with Memphis\u2019 defensive execution rather than just the opponent\u2019s proficiency. \n \n\u201cIn the box we have to be tighter and fight for the ball, because obviously we are being beaten to the ball and physically beaten in getting on the end of those, and it\u2019s just a matter of that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Mulrooney said. \u201cYou have to have a will to stop the other team, and obviously we haven\u2019t gotten that yet.\u201d \n \nMulrooney is also experimenting with making personnel changes on the defensive end, with sophomore Jake Leeker earning the start in goal Monday afternoon in place of incumbent senior Cody Uzcategui. The head coach noted that there was a close race between the two in preseason for the starting goalkeeper job, and he could continue to give both players looks until one asserts himself as the man for the job. \n \nOutside of small mistakes the Tigers played well enough to win both of their first two games, and with a difficult upcoming schedule failure to capitalize on those opportunities could come back to bite them. \n \nMemphis\u2019 next four games all come on the road, and each is against a 2014 NCAA Tournament team. The U of M will face No. 14 Saint Louis, SIU-Edwardsville, Kentucky and No. 15 Louisville in the difficult stretch, and if the current issues aren\u2019t corrected the Tigers could easily see their two-game slide snowball into a much longer streak. \n \nThe Tigers are familiar with each of their next four opponents except Kentucky, having faced Louisville in an exhibition last season and defeated both SIU-Edwardsville and Saint Louis in the regular season. \n \nAccording to Mulrooney, both the familiarity with the opponents and the added pressure of needing a win could bring the best out of the Tigers in the difficult games this weekend. \n \n\u201cI see it as just a big challenge, I really do,\u201d the second-year head coach said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as something that we can\u2019t overcome. These next two games are teams that we beat last year, and I know that\u2019s last year and I know it was at home, but the confidence should be there that we can play with these teams because we did it last year.\u201d \n \nMemphis will travel to St. Louis to take on the Billikens Friday evening, with kickoff set for 7 p.m. The Tigers will then have a quick turnaround before playing SIU-Edwardsville at 1 p.m. Sunday.","title":"Problems plague Tigers men\u2019s soccer in 0-2 start","media-type":"News","source":"Daily Helmsman","published":"2015-09-02T11:11:20Z"}

Source: Supplied  \n    \nPut simply, it means that we over-estimate our ability to pay for something in the future if we don\u2019t have to worry about it for the time being. \n\nIt makes us less likely to care about a higher interest rate that will kick in 12 months down the track, or to factor in the possibility that an unforeseen disaster could obliterate our ability to pay. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite calculated,\u201d said Ms Temple. \n\n\u201cWe need structural change, to make sure people aren\u2019t being given credit cards that they can\u2019t afford to repay.\u201d \n\nMs Temple said tougher lending rules were needed, to stop banks from heaping massive debt on people who would never be able to pay them off. \n\n\u201cThe optimism bias means that we have a tendency to over-estimate our capacity to pay,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why balance transfers are so attractive \u2014 it\u2019s basically free money (in people\u2019s minds).\u201d \n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission acknowledged this phenomenon in its submission to the inquiry, noting: that \u201cpeople with strong optimism or present biases might begin with the intention of always paying off their balance in full and, based on this intention, may disregard the interest rate on a card in the belief they will not need to pay any interest.\u201d \n     \n If Carrie Bradshaw was real, there\u2019s a fair chance she\u2019d be calling a debt crisis line.  Source: News Corp Australia  \n    \nConsumer advocates say the banks are taking advantage of human nature, profiting from the mental glitch that leaves us vulnerable. \n\nMs Temple said that along with clearer product descriptions, credit card providers should be forced to base their eligibility assessment on whether the customer can pay off the maximum limit in full, to account for consumers\u2019 behavioural biases. \n\n\u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s based on whether you can pay the monthly minimum,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cSo if something happens \u2014 like job loss, or you get sick, or you have a relationship breakdown \u2014 you can find yourself in trouble.\u201d \n\nLike Carl Cavarra, the out-of-work tradie who is facing potential bankruptcy over a $90,000 debt. \n\nThe 34-year-old owes thousands on five different credit cards, on top of a hefty car loan, all approved while he was working fulltime as a bricklayer. \n\nAnd while he was able to afford the minimum payments on these debts while employed, a bad turn of luck left him stuck in a debt spiral. \n\nAfter seven years of physical labour, the bricklayer suffered a triple hernia that required surgery, bed rest \u2014 and left his earning capacity in limbo. \n\nDespite incurring the injury through repeated heavy lifting on the job, Mr Cavarra said, WorkCover deemed his case one of \u201cwear and tear\u201d, so he received no compensation. \n\nOn doctor\u2019s orders, he abandoned his career, moved back in with his parents and started an unsuccessful 10-month search for a new job. \n     \n Melbourne\u2019s Carl Cavarra is facing potential bankruptcy over his $90,000 debt.  Source: NewsComAu  \n    \nUnable to make his $1600 monthly loans repayments while living on a $489 a fortnight Centrelink allowance, Mr Cavarra found himself racking up even more debt by putting his living expenses on his credit cards \u2014 which have interest rates of between 18 and 23 per cent. \n\nIn the end, the cards were maxed out and the creditors came knocking. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked to consolidate my debts so I can make one payment, but the banks refuse,\u201d he said. \n\n\u201cThey want it paid off in five years, but that\u2019s impossible.\u201d \n\nWithout a job \u2014 despite having applied for hundreds this year \u2014 he was not eligible for a balance transfer. \n\n\u201cI reckon if I don\u2019t find a job by the end of this year, I will have to go bankrupt. I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s this situation that the Consumer Action Law Centre argues should be prevented by more stringent lending rules. \n\nWhile it may have been imprudent for Mr Cavarra to saddle himself with so much debt, not giving himself leeway for unforeseen circumstances that could impact his ability to pay, he is far from alone. \n\nAustralians owe a collective $32 billion on their credit cards , with the average card holder paying $700 a year in interest on debts that hover around $4,300. \n\nAnd many of them have no idea how much interest rate they are paying; a survey of 2200 credit card users by ME bank found that 73 per cent did not know their interest rate and 40 per cent did not know if their card had an annual fee. \n\nInquiry chairman and Labor senator Sam Dastyari accused the banks of running a \u201cconfusopoly\u201d, with credit cards marketed in a way that makes it hard for consumers to work out whether they are getting a good deal, amid all the bells and whistles of reward points schemes and promotions. \n\nConsumer group Choice called for credit card advertising to include the monthly cost for a consumer with an average card balance, in dollars, based on the interest rate and annual fee. \n\nThe credit card inquiry will report its finding to the Senate Economics References Committee by November 24. \n\nIf you are struggling to pay your debts, you can speak to an independent financial counsellor free of charge by phoning 1800 007 007. \n\ndana.mccauley@news.com.au \n Originally published as Mental glitch that\u2019s making us spend","title":"Mental glitch that\u2019s making us spend","media-type":"News","source":"Geelong Advertiser","published":"2015-09-04T05:09:21Z"}

{"id":"38b5c863-ab47-462f-8306-3f46679fe713","content":"How does a small town like Sausalito (7,000 residents) take advantage of tourism and the economic benefits it generates, but also manage the influx of visitors? How do we provide the infrastructure to support and welcome a million visitors every year, but not be overwhelmed by them? It\u2019s called \u201csustainable tourism\u201d and in my opinion it is an attainable state; it has in fact been very successful in other communities. There are lessons to be learned. \n\r\n\r \nThe tourists are not going to go away. Sausalito is a world class destination. No one wants to be the \u201canti-tourist, unfriendly\u201d Marin County city. Even Sausalito civic leaders will say they are not opposed to tourism as they recognize the fiscal benefits associated with it. But most agree it needs to be better managed; whether it\u2019s the bicyclists descending into town after an iconic ride across the Golden Gate Bridge, the hundreds of thousands getting off the ferry from San Francisco every year (it is, after all ranked by travel writers as the second most spectacular ferry ride in the world) or those arriving by car to dine along the waterfront, or catching a shuttle to the legendary Muir Woods. Sausalito is a gateway to the famous California wine country and west Marin. It is a popular and much heralded destination \u2013 by land or by sea. \n\r\n\r \nTo be clear, I am not opposed to tourism. I am proud of what Sausalito has to offer and believe our city could not thrive as it does without the dollars these visitors bring to town. Between the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) that the city collects from restaurants, hotels and retailers (over a $1 million a year) and the other taxes and fees that businesses in Sausalito generate, it is estimated that 50% of the City\u2019s operational budget is derived from local business, specifically the tourist\/hospitality industry in town. Sausalito would be hard pressed to find alternative resources to fund their infrastructure improvements, parks, libraries and other city services if it weren\u2019t for the income our visitors generate. \n\r\n\r Managing Not Deterring Tourism \r\n\r \nI do believe that Sausalito needs to manage its tourism industry better and not deter it. A bike valet program is great, but right in the middle of an already congested three-block area in the center of town? The city needs to move the masses from this crowded area of downtown where the ferry lands, the buses park and the taxis wait. Spreading the transport support system even a few blocks further north would ease the current grid lock. \n\r\n\r \nDriving more commerce to Caledonia and other parts of town is not a bad idea as it expands Sausalito\u2019s corridor of commerce. Staging shuttles and bike parking at Cavallo Point or further north, offering ferry and water taxi service in other areas, taking advantage of bicycle trailers where tourists can drop their bikes and not worry about getting them back to the city are all possible solutions. Even investing in infrastructure and improvements in the Marin Ship (red flag, red flag!) would all be wise considerations. I am not suggesting we pave paradise and put up a parking lot, but a walking and bike path along the shoreline would help relieve some of the downtown congestion. \n\r\n\r \nNo one wants taxis and tour buses taking over neighborhoods or souvenir shops and bars displacing pharmacies and green grocers as they have in Venice and Barcelona. Sausalito has done a decent job of controlling growth through their zoning \u2013 no big box stores or \u201cchain stores\u201d have been allowed for years; ostensibly, only independent retailers are allowed (although the formula retail ordinance is often loosely interpreted and needs revision). Tour buses are required to exit town to the north, not the south; there are more bike racks; there are bicycle ambassadors. The Chamber has done a stellar job of assisting with the downtown congestion via their information kiosk and working with Golden Gate Transit to manage the bicycle loading on and off the ferries. \n\r\n\r \nI am not suggesting that nothing has been done. There is at long last even a Marin Ship Steering Committee to suggest revisions to the Marin Ship plan which is seriously outdated. \u00a0Strides have been made; just not enough or fast enough. \n\r\n\r Low Volume-High Value Tourism \r\n\r \nIn a great New York Times article by Elizabeth Becker (July 17, 2015), the author chronicles how other cities are tackling the problem. Denmark, she notes, welcomed over 9 million tourists last year; they have a population of fewer than 6 million. They have \u201cquiet zones\u201d in residential sections of Copenhagen; they have prohibited foreigners from buying vacation homes in their coastal areas and they have a bicycle-friendly transportation system to include tourists and locals alike. \n\r\n\r \nIn France, the most visited country in the world, tourism has actually contributed to the protection and nurturing of the country\u2019s culture, landscape and quality of life. As Becker writes: \u201cIn practical terms, that means tourism is promoted and subsidized, but also regulated, at all levels of government, in all matters of policy.\u201d \n\r\n\r \nThe Effiel Tower is the most heavily visited paid attraction in the world, with 7 million visitors a year. Tickets are limited and timed, security it discreet but significant, loitering is forbidden and street vendors are strictly regulated. Paris is first and foremost for Parisians but still welcomes and manages its tourists. Sausalito should do the same. \n\r\n\r \nGranted these are larger cities, but the issues are the same and perhaps more dramatic in a smaller town such as Sausalito. \n\r\n\r \nThe key concept is low volume, high value tourism quality vs. quantity. More discerning visitors who spend more time and more money in town and low impact local businesses that drive high-volume dollars. Clearly there needs to be more conscientious consideration at City Hall when it comes to what sorts of businesses are let into town. Business should be resident serving as well as tourist friendly. \n\r\n\r \nCampaigns that target more high value tourism and generate tourist traffic during off-seasons and mid-week could help, as would special events in slower seasons that bring well-heeled visitors to town. Sausalito has a limited number of hotel rooms and even fewer large event spaces, but by targeting corporate meeting planners, destination management companies and bringing in small to medium groups on expense accounts who stay for more than an ice cream cone and a day seems to be a viable approach for cultivating a different tourist clientele. \n\r\n\r Leadership at City Hall \r\n\r \nMost importantly, as I have noted in previous blog posts, there needs to be more leadership at City Hall, more governance and more effort to promote sustainable tourism. There is a city appointed Hospitality Committee, a Business Advisory Committee, a Chamber of Commerce \u2013 there are many bodies in place that can work together to better balance the impact of tourism. And they need to be supported by our civic leaders.\u00a0 \n\r\n\r \nWhile I am all for managing tourism in a sustainable fashion, I am not an advocate of the current petition circulating in Sausalito which calls for a ballot initiative next year which would force City Hall to adopt a plan for dealing with tourism. In my mind, tourism is a constant issue for the city, it should always be on their agenda and a serious budget issue based on the demand it places on city services, but not something forced by the voters in an election year. City Hall should always be working on striking a balance and achieving sustainable tourism. \n\r\n\r \nThe City of Sausalito should adopt a better plan, as residents have argued, but making it a ballot issue politicizes an already divisive town further in my mind. I do however agree with local resident Russ Irwin however, when he says \u201ctourism will shape us if we don\u2019t shape it.\u201d","title":"Sausalito and Sustainable Tourism","media-type":"News","source":"Marin Magazine","published":"2015-09-23T21:44:42Z"}

{"id":"d53fbb91-bb0e-4115-ab37-99ae53bd7042","content":"Back in June, during my first few weeks in my new job , my days were busy. Extremely busy. So busy, in fact, that pretty much every minute of every workday was filled with a meeting to attend or a task to accomplish. Other than the occasional quick restroom break, I spent all of my time those days either at my desk or in a meeting room. I even ate lunch at my desk while trying to catch up on work. Anytime you start a new job, you spend the first few weeks drinking from the proverbial firehose, so I wasn't surprised by how busy I was. And to be honest, I found the learning process exhilarating and exciting, if also a bit exhausting. Now that I'm about three months into the new gig, the days are still quite busy, but they have grown more manageable. That means I'm able to take short breaks during the day, sometimes escaping our freezing office space to thaw out with a walk around the block or stretching my legs with a quick jaunt through the hallways of the building. These breaks always help me gather my thoughts, refocus on the tasks I've got to do next and prepare mentally for the coming block of work time. Personal experiences like these have made me a big believer in the benefits of breaks. I see them as little opportunities to build work-life balance in the middle of an average day at the office. As such, I was interested to read the results of a new study on work breaks from two researchers in Baylor University\u2019s Hankamer School of Business. According to a Baylor press release about the study, researchers Emily Hunter and Cindy Wu, associate professors of management, surveyed 95 employees (ages 22-67) over a five-day workweek. Each person was asked to document each break he or she took during that time, excluding bathroom breaks. Hunter and Wu then analyzed a total of 959 break surveys, or an average of two breaks per person per day. They said in the press release that the results of the study should be beneficial to both managers and employees. \u201cWe took some of our layperson hypotheses about what we believed were helpful in a break and tested those empirically in the best way possible,\u201d Hunter said in the release. \u201cWhat we found was that a better workday break was not composed of many of the things we believed.\u201d Page 2 of 3 - For example, many residents of Cubeville like to push through their mornings, staying busy and delaying any breaks until lunchtime . I often find myself in that situation. But Hunter and Wu found that a break earlier in the workday replenishes more of an employee's resources of energy, concentration and motivation. \u201cWe found that when more hours had elapsed since the beginning of the work shift, fewer resources and more symptoms of poor health were reported after a break,\u201d the study said. \u201cTherefore, breaks later in the day seem to be less effective.\u201d They also found that better breaks incorporated activities that employees preferred, even if those activities were work-related. \u201cFinding something on your break that you prefer to do \u2014 something that\u2019s not given to you or assigned to you \u2014 are the kinds of activities that are going to make your breaks much more restful, provide better recovery and help you come back to work stronger,\u201d Hunter said in the press release. I've definitely found this to be true. If I'm working on an assigned task during a break \u2014 like reading a report during lunch \u2014 it doesn't feel like a break at all. But if I spend that downtime on a work or personal project of my choice, I'm much more refreshed and rejuvenated when the break is done. And that's important, because the study also found that taking good breaks led workers to experience fewer maladies like headaches, eyestrain and lower back pain at work. Employees who took good breaks also had better job satisfaction and less burnout, according to the study. This is definitely information bosses should ponder. The team I manage is an incredibly hard-working group, and I worry that they're going to get burned out . If I pay more attention to their schedules and encourage them to take breaks \u2014 and model that behavior myself \u2014 perhaps I can help them avoid that problem. But how long should breaks last to be beneficial? Unfortunately, the Baylor study didn't have a solid answer to that question, although the research did seem to find that more frequent, shorter breaks were associated with more positive outcomes for workers. \u201cUnlike your cellphone, which popular wisdom tells us should be depleted to zero percent before you charge it fully to 100 percent, people instead need to charge more frequently throughout the day,\u201d Hunter said in the press release. That makes sense to me. After all, no one likes a dead battery. I'd be interested to hear your reactions to this study. How often do you take breaks during the workday, and when do they usually occur? How long do they last? What kinds of breaks are most beneficial to you? What suggestions would you offer to people who aren't sure how to manage their work breaks? Page 3 of 3 - Send me an email or leave a comment online, and I'll share some of your responses in a future column. And one more thing. If you're looking for a quick break every Tuesday morning, reading my column would probably give you a solid 5-7 minutes away from the daily grind.

It was also the German's first pole since Brazil 2013. \n\nRemarkably, not only did Vettel claim pole by half a second from Daniel Ricciardo with his Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen a further two tenths adrift, but he beat the fifth-placed Lewis Hamilton, chasing a record-equalling eighth consecutive pole in F1, by over 1.4 seconds. With Nico Rosberg a place behind Hamilton, it was, by a distance, Mercedes' worst result of F1's new turbo era. \n\n\"It's a surprise. I thought they were sandbagging because there's no doubt they have the strongest package this year,\" said a startled Vettel. \"They must have some issues. \n\n\"But I wouldn't rule them out for tomorrow. It's not the easiest circuit to overtake, but if you have the pace you can come through. So I expect them to be strong tomorrow.\" \n\nIt would certainly be foolish to write off Mercedes but Ferrari, closely followed by Red Bull, appear to have boasted a significant pace advantage all weekend with Vettel consistently a step ahead of Raikkonen and the chasing pack. \n\nBut why? Ferrari introduced a brand-new upgraded engine two weeks ago at Monza, a change which immediately coincided with better single-lap pace from the Scuderia. However, the team are adamant that their new engines couldn't have been a factor in their unexpected superiority under the Marina Bay lights. \n\n\"The effect of horsepower around here is about point one of a second so it's inconceivable you could make that sort of difference with horsepower,\" a bemused but delighted James Allision told Sky Sports F1. \"The gap to Red Bull is more or less what it should be around this sort of track but the strange thing is how slow the Mercs were.\" \n\nSebastian Vettel celebrates after landing his first pole for Ferrari in Singapore \n\nSo was it a case of Ferrari making gains while Mercedes lost their way to create the perfect qualifying storm? While a frustrated Hamilton attributed his lack of speed to gripless tyres, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff admitted his team were at a loss to understand the scale of their defeat. \n\n\"Shocked is probably not the right word but we are very surprised,\" said Wolff to Sky Sports F1. \"We have been surprised from the beginning onwards. We start with a certain simulation and what you expect from the track and somehow it hasn't worked. It could be many various factors. We've been very good for two years and not put a foot wrong but this time it was a step backwards.\" \n\nYet the last word must go to Vettel as the German celebrated his first pole position in Ferrari colours. \"It's a street circuit and the better you feel, the closer you get to the walls, the quicker you can go,\" he added. \"It's a circuit where the driver can make the difference.\" \n\nAnd yes, the finger is back... \n\nDon't miss Sky Sports F1's exclusively live coverage of the 2015 Singapore GP.

On the one hand, I am keen to return to actually having plans for that involve something other than socialising and drinking. On the other hand, I am keen to retain spending every day drinking and socialising! But on a serious note, I do want to continue hurtling towards the moment of qualifying as a solicitor. \n \nAside from my return to responsibility land, another source of apprehension is the mixed reviews I\u2019ve heard about what the LPC is like. Some have told me it\u2019s easy; others have said it\u2019s too hard and a third group, seemingly unfazed by its difficulty, have told me it\u2019s just plain boring. None of these adjectives inspire confidence, but I\u2019m determined to enter the course with an open mind and report back to my reader(s) as objectively as possible! So far, points to note are that the University of Law (ULaw) uses Office365 instead of Gmail (which my univeristy used) as its email client... which is a fairly cluttered email provider, from my previous experience of it. In addition, ULaw uses an online learning environment called Blackboard as opposed to the Moodle I got used to at Greenwich. Thus far, neither of these banal facts have confirmed or denied the aspersions\u00a0previously cast to me.\u00a0 \n \nSpeaking of reporting back, while I was in Canada I did actually go to a court room and watch a Canadian court case! (Sad right?) I mean, there\u2019s a slightly less sad explanation in that the judge was my friend\u2019s old boss, but I feel this will not prevent the decrease in my coolness levels right now\u2026 as if it were ever high! In any case, it was largely the same as a court in the United Kingdp, \u2013 what with Canada being a common law country, this is unsurprising \u2013 however, there was slightly less formality. No one said \"your lordship\", \"my learned friend\" or other deferential terms. In all, it seemed slightly more conversational in style \u2013 but nevertheless equally as nerve-wracking for the lawyers, I\u2019m sure. Also, the lawyers didn\u2019t wear gowns, just suits \u2013 not even darkly coloured suits at that (the horror)!

{"id":"fd1ef652-6ed4-4412-9dd2-0e363d45918d","content":"OLDWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \n\nA.M. Best has affirmed the financial strength rating (FSR) of B+ (Good) and the issuer credit ratings (ICR) of \"bbb-\" of MVP Health Plan, Inc. and its affiliate, MVP Health Service Corp. Additionally, A.M. Best has upgraded the FSR to B+ (Good) from B (Fair) and the ICR of \"bbb-\" from \"bb\" of MVP Health Insurance Company. Concurrently, A.M. Best has withdrawn the FSR of B (Fair) and the ICR of \"bb\" of MVP Health Insurance Company of New Hampshire, Inc. (Bedford, NH). The outlook for all ratings remains stable, except for the outlook on MVP Health Services Corp\u2019s ratings, which was revised to stable from negative. Collectively, all companies are subsidiaries of their direct parent, MVP Health Care, Inc., and are domiciled in Schenectady, NY, unless otherwise specified. \n\nThe upgrading of the ratings of MVP Health Insurance Company reflects its revised strategic role within the group, with greater emphasis on commercial large group business in Vermont. Moreover, significant improvement in operating results has been recorded through mid-2015 and is projected to continue into 2016. \n\nThe outlook revision to stable for MVP Health Service Corp reflects its change in strategic direction, resulting in favorable growth in premium and recent improvement in operating results that is projected to continue into 2016. A.M. Best will continue its discussions with the management team about its revised strategy for this entity, while assessing the capitalization, premium leverage and future direction within the group. A.M. Best anticipates that the parent organization will continue to implicitly and explicitly support the entity to fund its future growth initiatives. \n\nThe rating affirmations of MVP Health Plan, Inc. and its affiliate reflect the companies\u2019 strong brand recognition in New York and well-established network with geographic outreach activities throughout the state, which enhances each entity\u2019s stand-alone assessment as well as the group\u2019s ongoing consolidation of operations and overall sound capitalization. The group gained a larger increase in individual membership due to some carriers not originally being as active in the exchange marketplace. A.M. Best notes that while the group has reported consistent net income over the past three years, it has recorded underwriting losses over the past two years. Management has implemented strategic initiatives to return the group to profitable trends, and through mid-2015, the consolidated operating results have been very favorable. Due to these initiatives, A.M. Best expects the organization to return to its historical level of profitability and maintain a steady growth across its various business lines. The sound but declining level of risk-adjusted capital levels is primarily the result of previous cumulative retained earnings. \n\nA.M. Best believes that the organization has been pressured by the competitive nature of the commercial market, which is driving significant margin compression on existing and new business. Additionally, the continued shift toward government-sponsored lines of business has been challenging. Moreover, the organization faces continued challenges in the operating performance of its Medicare Advantage business line, which is government-funded and heavily impacted by reimbursement cuts. \n\nOf note is the considerable contribution of the Medicaid product line to the organization\u2019s consolidated operating performance, driven by strong results produced through its acquisition of the Hudson Health Plan (HHP). In August 2013, MVP Health Plan, Inc. acquired HHP, a Tarrytown, NY-based Medicaid managed care organization. As this entity continues to be integrated into MVP Health Plan, Inc., A.M. Best will continue to assess the ultimate impact of the HHP acquisition on the organization and its overall operations, strategic plans, earnings and capitalization. \n\nThe withdrawal of the ratings on MVP Health Insurance Company of New Hampshire, Inc. reflects management\u2019s decision to exit the New Hampshire market and place its relatively small remaining policies into run-off. The run-off and completion of the withdrawal from New Hampshire is expected to be completed by early 2016. \n\nA.M. Best believes that positive rating movement is unlikely in the near to medium term. Key rating drivers that could lead to a negative rating action include further deterioration in operating performance in any of its core lines of business, a substantial decline in the consolidated risk-adjusted capitalization or any reimbursement issues surrounding its government-sponsored products. \n\nThis press release relates to rating(s) that have been published on A.M. Best's website.

{"id":"783b29ce-92bb-4924-a4e0-70f9f2e3d7aa","content":"This story first appeared in the Sept. 25 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. To receive the magazine, click here to subscribe . \n\r \nAll of the roughly 19,000  members of the TV Academy belong to one of 29 \"peer groups\" (i.e., actors, writers, etc.) and are entitled to vote for the nominees \u2014 and, as of this year, also the win\u00adners \u2014 in the categories that pertain to their specific area of expertise; for series categories, all members vote. THR 's awards analyst Scott Feinberg spoke with one producer who has won an Emmy himself but who has no ties to this year's nominees to learn how he voted \u2014 and why. \n\r \nOUTSTANDING DRAMA SERIES \n\r \nI would have dumped Homeland , House of Cards and Downton Abbey and put in Bloodline , which was incredibly well done; The Good Wife , which made a really strong comeback this year and would have been nominated if it was on cable or a streaming service; and \u2014 don't laugh \u2014 Daredevil , a comic book show done ridiculously well that features the most watchable actor on television, Vincent D'Onofrio \u2014 in $5,000 suits! Downton Abbey , I confess, is not a show I watch; I've sampled it but I cannot get through it \u2014 I'd rather have hemorrhoid surgery. I wrote \"WTF?\" next to Homeland 's nomination; its first two seasons were as good as anything on television, but as soon as they \u2014 spoiler alert \u2014 hanged [ Damian Lewis during season three], it stopped being watchable and sort of became the drama version of the Tim Robbins show [ The Brink ]. I'm glad Orange Is the New Black , which has incredibly fresh performances and direction, was moved to the drama category; shows written in a room by comedy writers should compete against each other, but Orange isn't written that way and isn't that kind of a show. \n\r\n\r \nKudos to Netflix for giving really creative people free range, which is how the best work gets made \u2014 although it also can go terribly wrong, as in the case of House of Cards . I binge-watched the first season in two days and was a huge fan; then it had a weak second season; and then it totally jumped the shark this season \u2014 I was literally looking around for Henry Winkler , a small pool, a shark and a motorcycle. They just lost their way with a Sam and Diane moment: [ Kevin Spacey 's Frank Underwood] wants to be president in the worst way \u2014 and they made him president! Don't. Do. That. (It did have one good episode, the season finale, thanks to Michael Kelly , who was the only reason I kept watching.) I did not expect Better Call Saul to get nominated, but it absolutely deserves to be in there. Mad Men will probably win for its last season, which was very good \u2014 I liked that they didn't wrap everything up in a bow but also didn't just cut to black like The Sopranos . But Game of Thrones is the most important show on television. The scale of it and the amount of talk it generates is unparalleled; nobody wants to get to Monday without having seen what happened on Sunday, and that takes me back to the way TV was when I was growing up. \n\r \nMY VOTE Game of Thrones (HBO) \n\r \n\n\r \nOUTSTANDING COMEDY SERIES \n\r \nI'm delighted Parks and Rec was nominated \u2014 there's an unfortunate prejudice against broadcast network shows, but Amy Poehler 's work was outstanding and the cast is extraordinary. Silicon Valley and Transparent should have been nominated \u2014 [ Silicon 's] T.J. Miller plays one of the funniest characters on television and [ Transparent 's] Judith Light is one of the most underappreciated actresses out there. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is terrific, but I was surprised it made it. I adore Modern Family and would have voted for it for the first three seasons, but it's now being nominated on its reputation \u2014 it did not have a very good season. Veep is a nice comedy \u2014 Julia Louis-Dreyfus is amazing \u2014 but I don't think the show is Emmy-worthy. (I would've taken out Modern Family and Veep and replaced them with Black-ish and Jane the Virgin .) But the bottom line is, there's Louie and then there's everything else. I don't understand how it hasn't already won. It's so groundbreaking and original; we'll look back on it as one of the great comedy series of all time. \n\r \nMY VOTE Louie (FX) \n\r \n\n\r \n'Louie' \n\r \nOUTSTANDING LIMITED SERIES \n\r \nFirst of all, it's nice to see a limited series category, but they still need to figure out what it means \u2014 it's like the three-card monte game of the Emmys. It should be easy to distinguish a limited series from a series: If you have a giant staff of writers and you're putting out a show with a different director every week, and you have actors who have contracts with options for multiple seasons, you're a series, and you shouldn't be able to compete as a limited series; if one or two guys are doing six or eight or 10 hours, you're a limited series. American Horror Story , which is not really my thing, is an out-and-out series \u2014 it's had a continuous writing staff, supervising director and EP. The same actors appear in every season and know, when they wrap one, that they're coming back for another \u2014 maybe as a different character in a different story, but so what? The same was true for The Twilight Zone , which was a drama series. Putting a colon in the title and changing the subtitle every year does not make you a limited series \u2014 and gives you the same sort of unfair advantage that putting \" Hallmark Hall of Fame: \" at the front of titles used to, which is frustrating for people who actually make limited series. \n\r \nAmerican Crime is coming back, so it should be a drama series, but I liked it very much. I would never have nominated Wolf Hall or The Honorable Woman \u2014 they were like watching paint dry. HBO shows get nominated because they're on HBO, which spends an enormous amount of money telling America: \"We're not TV. We're HBO.\" And it has worked \u2014 people internalize that and then vote for something in a category like this solely because it aired on HBO. There is no way Olive Kitteridge , with its pedantic pacing and obtuse storytelling, would have gotten the number of nominations it did \u2014 or would win, which it's going to \u2014 if it was on any other network. I'm going with American Crime , mainly because I can't vote for The Missing , which was the best thing on television this year. The fact that it wasn't nominated illustrates why it was a mistake to get rid of the blue-ribbon panels, which I used to serve on, for the nominations phase of voting. I didn't even know The Missing existed until someone told me to watch the screener, and thankfully Starz sent screeners of the whole thing, unlike some networks that send episodes one and seven or whatever ran\u00addom selections. \n\r\n\r \nMY VOTE  American Crime (ABC) \n\r \n\n\r \n'American Crime' \n\r \nOUTSTANDING TV MOVIE \n\r \nThere are a lot of really hard-working TV movie producers out there and the mission of the Television Academy is to celebrate people like them who work in television every day \u2014 come to work, put on their headset and do everything they can to make movies in probably the most difficult genre left in our business. I think about the number of places that made TV movies 10 years ago and the number of places that make them now, and I take my hat off to the people who are still doing it. So what do they do? They nominate two feature films [ Grace of Monaco and Nightingale ] that just couldn't get theatrical releases and give them two slots that could have gone to people who actually make TV. Furthermore, are we really still so in love with the Brits that we're nominating stuff like Agatha Christie's Poirot: Curtain, Poirot's Last Case ? Prime Suspect is one thing, but are you kidding me \u2014 Poirot for the 400th time? I watched 15 minutes of it and fell asleep. Peter Ustinov put that to bed. I didn't care for Hello Ladies or Killing Jesus \u2014 I wish they had nominated Whitney , which had a stunning main performance. That leaves Bessie , which is absolutely a deserving winner. \n\r \nMY VOTE Bessie (HBO) \n\r \n\n\r \n'Bessie' \n\r \nOUTSTANDING VARIETY SKETCH SERIES \n\r \nI think SNL had a really off year \u2014 they're obviously the institution, but they're slacking. I love [ Inside Amy Schumer 's ] Amy Schumer  \u2014 she goes right out to the edge of the diving board every episode and never falls off, and her 12 Angry Men parody was the best episode of any of these shows. Portlandia and Drunk History are hit or miss. I voted for Key & Peele because it's the funniest show on television and I am so crushed they are going off the air \u2014 they are completely original, completely without parameters and will go after anyone in an unbelievably clever way. \n\r \nMY VOTE Key & Peele (Comedy Central) \n\r\n\r \nOUTSTANDING VARIETY TALK SERIES \n\r \nI can't quarrel with any of these nominees. [ Jimmy ] Kimmel and [ Jimmy ] Fallon are really good and reshaping the format \u2014 and I don't know why anyone would ever host an Emmys or an Oscars with some\u00adone other than one of them. With [ Stephen ] Colbert , [ Jon ] Stewart and [ David ] Letterman all saying goodbye this year, this is sort of the farewell-tour category. I'm a dedicated Stewart fan \u2014 he changed the game and will always be the gold standard \u2014 but I think he was sort of mailing it in this year, as Letterman has been doing for several years. (I would have been happy to replace Letterman and Colbert with Conan [ O'Brien of Conan ] and [ Real Time 's Bill ] Maher .) But in my opinion, the best show, week to week, was John Oliver 's. Granted, he has a whole week to prep his show, while the others have to do four or five a week \u2014 but I imagine all those other guys also work with much bigger writ\u00ading staffs, which sort of evens the playing field. \n\r \nMY VOTE  Last Week Tonight With John Oliver (HBO) \n\r \n\n\r \nOUTSTANDING REALITY COMPETITION PROGRAM \n\r \nBoring. These are the same nominees every year and I wouldn't choose to watch any of them \u2014 I have never seen So You Think You Can Dance or Project Runway , but I have watched Amazing Race , Dancing With the Stars and The Voice because they have been on in my house. I called up my family and asked them what I should vote for and they told me The Voice , which I found acceptable because I do think [creator] Mark Burnett is the Ed Sullivan of our day. But at the end of the day, does anyone besides the people who make these shows really care? The Amazing Race has won 10 out of the 12 years: They're like the Celtics in the '60s \u2014 I don't know why anybody else bothers to suit up. \n\r \nMY VOTE The Voice (NBC) \n\r \n\n\r \nOUTSTANDING STRUCTURED REALITY PROGRAM \n\r \nI have seen every one of the nom\u00adinated shows except Property Brothers . I'm a fan of MythBusters , but it's been on a long time and they've sort of run out of myths. There have been episodes of Undercover Boss that I've liked, but each one really depends on whether or not they've found a great boss. Nothing comes close to Shark Tank . I'm a huge Mark Burnett fan, and this one is so well done that its title has now become part of the lexicon. And any time I can see Mark Cuban berating other billionaires, how would I not be into that? \n\r \nMY VOTE Shark Tank (ABC) \n\r \nOUTSTANDING UNSTRUCTURED REALITY PROGRAM \n\r \nI don't watch any of these reg\u00adularly. I saw two episodes of Wahlburgers on an international flight when there was nothing else left to watch on my little TV. And I've seen a few episodes of Intervention and I respect what they do for people battling addiction. \n\r \nMY VOTE  Intervention (A&E)","title":"Brutally Honest Emmys Ballot: Producer Skewers 'House of Cards,' 'Homeland' (\"I Wrote 'WTF?'\")","media-type":"News","source":"Hollywood Reporter","published":"2015-09-17T16:00:00Z"}

The Roosters lead for most of the voting period but Melbourne surged back over the weekend to take out the match with a 50.18% share of the vote \u2014 or by a margin of just nine votes.\n\n\u2022 The 2002 Roosters also went down in their other clash against the 2003 Panthers with Penrith winning another nail biter after getting 50.88% of the vote. In something of a shock result, both Roosters teams have been bounced in the first round.\n\n\u2022 Newcastle enjoyed the most lopsided victory in Round 1 when they belted the 1999 Storm after gaining 71.88% of the vote.\n\n\u2022 When our Random Match Generator (also known as picking the teams out of a hat) threw up the Manly vs. Manly clash in Round 1 it raised more outcry than a Daly Cherry-Evans backflip, but in the end the people of the Northern Beaches voted with their clicks and sent the 2008 Sea Eagles through to the quarterfinals. They trashed their 2011 counterparts after gaining 70.74% of the vote and given the feedback on Facebook and Twitter they\u2019d be considered one of the favourites to go all the way.\n\n\u2022 Brisbane fans came out in force with the 2006 Broncos earning 62.66% of the vote to smack the 2005 Tigers, the 1998 premiers downing the 2014 Rabbitohs after getting 59.44% of the vote and the 2000 Broncos bringing the pain against the 2012 Storm, running away with 62.27% of the vote.\n\n\u2022 True to form, the 2004 Bulldogs are flying right under the radar and got past the 2010 Dragons with 55.38% of the vote.\n\nOn to the quarterfinals VETERAN: OUT: Pearce succumbs to hamstring injury\n\n2003 Penrith Panthers vs. 2006 Brisbane Broncos 2003 Penrith Panthers Season record: 21-6\n\nWins by 1-12: 12\n\nWins by 13+: 9\n\nAverage winning margin: 11.76\n\nWins over top eight teams: 13\n\nDespite surging to the minor premiership and winning an incredible 20 of their last 23 games, the 2003 Panthers were counted as title outsiders right up until grand final day. Their average winning margin of 11.76 is the lowest of any team still in contention but they have the equal highest number of wins over top eight sides.\n\n2006 Brisbane Broncos\n\nSeason record: 17-11\n\nWins by 1-12: Five\n\nWins by 13+: 12\n\nAverage winning margin: 17.47\n\nThe 2006 Broncos have the worst overall record of any of the teams remaining and are the only team left who lost more than 10 matches. They also boast the longest losing streak of any team left in the tournament after they dropped five matches on the trot between Round 18 and Round 23. Their average margin of victory is a respectable 17.47, which places them firmly in the middle of the pack, but the 2006 Broncos have the look of a team that was competitive without being dominant in the regular season who managed to hit form at just the right time to surge into the title picture.\n\n1998 Brisbane Broncos vs. 2007 Melbourne Storm 1998 Brisbane Broncos Season record: 21-6-1\n\nWins by 1-12: Seven\n\nWins by 13+: 14\n\nAverage winning margin: 24.48\n\nWins over top eight teams: 10\n\nAfter the first week of the Premiership Tournament it was clear that the 1998 Broncos were overwhelmingly strong title favourites and when we dig into the stats we can see why. They have the third greatest number of 13+ wins among remaining teams and the highest average winning margin. While these numbers are impressive, it\u2019s worth remembering what kind of competition the NRL was in 1998. In the bloated, newly united competition there were 20 teams, which meant that the footballing talent was spread way too thin. This created a serious world of the haves and the have nots, and nobody had more than Brisbane. That\u2019s not to say the 1998 Broncos were flat track bullies, but all stats need to be examined in the proper context.\n\n2007 Melbourne Storm\n\nSeason record: 24-3\n\nWins by 1-12: Nine\n\nWins by 13+: 15\n\nAverage winning margin: 19.21\n\nThe decision to include a Melbourne team that was over the salary cap was controversial to say the least, but their clash with the 1998 Broncos promises to be one for the ages. This Storm side have the best record of all remaining teams and the second highest number of 13+ wins. Throw in an equal-highest 13 victories against top eight teams and its easy to see why they\u2019re one of the stronger teams still in contention. Winning 16 of their last 17 and outscoring their finals opposition 100-18 wasn\u2019t too shabby either. MAGIC: SHARKNADO: Cronulla charter fan flight to Townsville \n\n2008 Manly Sea Eagles vs. 2001 Newcastle Knights \n\n2008 Sea Eagles\n\nSeason record: 20-7\n\nWins by 1-12: Three\n\nWins by 13+: 17\n\nAverage winning margin: 21.85\n\nWins over top eight teams: Nine\n\nWith the exception of the 1998 Broncos, no team got more love in Round 1 than the 2008 Sea Eagles. While they weren\u2019t able to snag the minor premiership, they did record the highest number of 13+ wins among active teams with an incredible 17. They also have the second highest average margin of victory with 21.85, but notably only beat nine top eight teams all season, the lowest total among teams still in contention. One of the real strings to their bow remains their imperious run through the finals, where they outscored their opposition 110-12 in possibly the most dominant finals series ever.\n\n2001 Newcastle Knights\n\nSeason record: 19-9-1\n\nWins by 1-12: 10\n\nWins by 13+: Nine\n\nAverage winning margin: 19.23\n\nWins over top eight teams: 10\n\nStatistically, the 2001 Knights were the second best attacking team of all time (trailing only the team the beat in the grand final, the 2001 Parramatta Eels) but their pointscoring aptitude isn\u2019t really reflected in the stats. Their average winning margin of 19.23 is good without being great and their 10 wins over top eight teams is of similar standard. This team definitely had an attitude that the best form of defence was more offence, while their 19-9-1 record is the second worst of any of the teams still in contention.\n\n2000 Brisbane Broncos vs. 2004 Canterbury Bulldogs 2000 Brisbane Broncos Season record: 21-6-2\n\nWins by 1-12: Nine\n\nWins by 13+: 12\n\nAverage winning margin: 19.05\n\nWins over top eight teams: 11\n\nThe 14-team competition that came about in 2000 meant that talent was more highly concentrated and, on the whole, teams had much more depth than they had in the chaotic Super League years. As a result, the 2000 Broncos average winning margin of 19.05 and 11 wins over top eight teams, which are both good enough for fourth among remaining teams, are ever more impressive. Minor premiers by six points, they might not have the prestige of their 1998 counterparts but they might fly under the radar and run all the way to the title.\n\n2004 Canterbury Bulldogs\n\nSeason record: 22-6\n\n1-12 wins: Nine\n\n13+ wins: 13\n\nAverage winning margin: 18.14\n\nWins over top eight teams: 12\n\nWith the second highest number of wins over top eight teams and the fourth most wins by over 13 points, the 2004 Bulldogs are arguably the most underrated team still in the tournament. While they finished second after losing the minor premiership to the Roosters on for and against, their 22 wins is the second highest among the remaining teams.","title":"NRL Premiership Tournament: Quarter Finals","media-type":"News","source":"NEWS.com.au","published":"2015-09-17T03:36:00Z"}

If all goes according to the state\u2019s plan, Kelly Gissendaner will be the first woman the state has executed in 70 years. She was sentenced to death in 1998 for plotting the death of her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, with her boyfriend. \n \nGissendaner drove her boyfriend, Gregory Owen, to her house, gave him the murder weapons \u2014 a nightstick and a hunting knife \u2014 and then went to a nightclub with friends, according to court documents. Owen ambushed Douglas and forced him to drive his car to a remote location that Gissendaner chose beforehand. \n \nOnce they arrived, Owen beat Douglas and stabbed him. Owen took Douglas\u2019s wedding ring and watch to make it look like a robbery. Gissendaner later arrived at the scene and helped her boyfriend burn her husband\u2019s body and car. Law enforcement was unable to find Douglas\u2019s body for weeks. \n   \nOwen accepted a plea deal and testified against Gissendaner. In exchange, he received a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Gissendaner refused to take a plea and lost when she went to trial. \n \nAs Gissendaner\u2019s execution date nears, two of her and Douglas\u2019s children are calling for her life to be spared. \n   \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our dad. We can\u2019t imagine losing our mom too,\u201d daughter Kayla Gissendaner said.  \n youtube.com \n   \nIn response, Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it was \u201cmanipulation.\u201d \n \n\u201cThe case began with manipulation by Kelly Gissendaner and it appears it will end with manipulation by Kelly Gissendaner,\u201d he said, adding that Douglas\u2019s parents have wanted the execution to go forward. \n \nOn Monday, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles announced that it will meet on Tuesday to \u201creceive and consider supplemental information\u201d about the case. Previously, the board had denied clemency. The board has the option to allow the denial of clemency to stay, to grant a stay of up to 90 days, or to grant clemency. The board has the sole authority to grant clemency in Georgia. \n \nThis is the third time the state has set an execution date for Gissendaner. The first time, it was called off because of the weather. The second time, it was called off after the execution drugs were found to have particles floating in them. \n           \nView this image \u203a \n  \nGeorgia\u2019s pentobarbital on the date it was scheduled to be used.  Georgia Department of Corrections \n   \nGeorgia, like some other death penalty states, obtains its execution drugs from a compounding pharmacy that mixes the drug up in secret. \n \nThe state concluded that the likeliest cause was that the drugs were stored at too cold of a temperature, although its expert floated the possibility that there was a problem with how it was mixed, and the state attempted to withhold test results that disagreed with its narrative. \n \nGissendaner\u2019s attorneys argued that the hours she waited not knowing if the \u201ccloudy\u201d drugs would be used on her amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, and that it showed the state was likely to use questionable drugs on her in the future. \n \nBut U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash disagreed, finding that the state \u201cdid not intentionally subject [her] to uncertainty for the sake of inflicting more pain upon her.\u201d \n \n\u201cIt is not enough to show that the State may obtain defective lethal injection drugs,\u201d the judge wrote when he dismissed the case in August. Gissendaner \u201cmust show that there is a substantial risk that the defective drugs will be used on\u201d her in the future. \n \nHe added that \u201cif anything, the March 2 incident shows that the state is unlikely to use defective drugs on\u201d her. \n \nGissendaner asked him to reconsider his ruling, which the judge declined to do. On Monday, Gissendaner notified the court that she was appealing the decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n \nGeorgia intends to use compounded drugs again, but this time plans on storing the drugs in a new refrigeration unit to regulate its temperature. \n \nGissendaner also has a petition at the Supreme Court seeking a stay of execution based on her claim that prison officials violated her rights by having \u201cthwarted\u201d the clemency process. \n \nClaiming that officials \u201cactively frustrated the [clemency] procedures established by Georgia law,\u201d Gissendaner\u2019s lawyers write that such actions violated her constitutional due process rights. \n   \nCheck out more articles on BuzzFeed.com!","title":"Georgia Plans To Execute Its Only Woman On Death Row On Tuesday","media-type":"News","source":"BuzzFeed","published":"2015-09-28T22:24:29Z"}

A poker player attacked and murdered the close friend of his former girlfriend's suspected lover, a court has heard. Crown prosecutor Tom Gyorffy, QC, told a Supreme Court jury on Wednesday that Collin Thomas became angry when George Anagnostellis refused to tell him where he could find his love rival.\n\nMr Gyorffy said Mr Thomas attacked Mr Anagnostellis, who was separated from his wife and living at his parents' home in Malvern East, before setting fire to the garage on April 11, 2014.\n\nMr Thomas has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder and one count of arson.\n\nMr Gyorffy said that at the time of his death, Mr Anagnostellis was an avid poker player who played and organised poker tournaments at local hotels.\n\nThe prosecutor described Mr Anagnostellis as a gentle man who was never violent or threatening to anyone.\n\nMr Gyorffy said Mr Thomas and his girlfriend, Tina Thwaites, who were both poker players, had been in a relationship for about a year when Ms Thwaites ended it some time before the alleged murder.\n\n\"Mr Thomas believed that she'd been having an affair with another poker player, Mr Billy Theoharis, and he was angry about that,\" the prosecutor told the jury.\n\n\"He was trying to track him (Mr Theoharis) down and was texting and calling his phone.\n\n\"Mr Theoharis was a good friend of the deceased man (Mr Anagnostellis).\"\n\nAfter playing poker at the Sandown Hotel, Mr Anagnostellis invited Mr Thomas, Andrew Heke and Scott Sullivan back to his parents' Malvern East home just after 1am on April 11.\n\nThe men went into the garage and sat around a table playing cards and drinking home-made ouzo and wine.\n\nBy 4.30am, Mr Sullivan became unwell and left the garage in a severely intoxicated state and was later picked up by his partner. Mr Heke was asleep at the table when Mr Sullivan left.\n\nMr Thomas then allegedly confronted Mr Anagnostellis about where he could find Mr Theoharis.\n\nMr Thomas later told police he assaulted Mr Anagnostellis about 20 to 30 times involving \"a mixture of punches, elbows, kicks, knees, head butts\" to the face, head and body.\n\n\"It's a bit of a blur,\" Mr Thomas told police.\n\n\"I'm not really too sure about how that went down. All I remember is getting to the point where I obviously felt angry enough to assault him.\n\n\"I was just not getting anywhere and just getting sandbagged and basically being treated like an idiot, like I didn't know anything. I wasn't getting the information, obviously, that I was after and I was getting frustrated.\"\n\nMr Thomas wanted to find Mr Theoharis because there were accusations he had \"slept with my girlfriend (Ms Thwaites) at the time\" in late 2013.\n\nMr Gyorffy said Mr Anagnostellis suffered a number of serious head and neck injuries from the beating which led to his death.\n\n\"The Crown says Mr Thomas then poured petrol on the floor and over Mr Anagnostellis' body and set it alight before he left the scene.\"\n\nDefence barrister Colin Mandy told the jury Mr Thomas did not deny assaulting Mr Thomas but claimed the last time he saw him he was alive and about to set fire to himself and the garage.\n\n\"He (Mr Thomas) told the police that he dragged Andrew Heke out of there and was blown out of the door by the explosion that happened,\" Mr Mandy said.\n\nThe trial, before Justice Jack Forrest, continues.

More than 4,000 healthcare professionals have participated in CPEP's programs ultimately improving the care of more than four million patients. \n\nCPEP launched in Colorado in 1990 with the goal of providing in-depth assessment and education to objectively address physician performance concerns. Within its first year, CPEP had participants from four other states and has since gone on to serve a national audience. \"I don't think anyone ever imagined that CPEP would have the impact and national reach that it has today\" said Beth Korinek , chief executive officer for CPEP. \n   \nJandel Allen-Davis , vice president of government, external relations, and research, Kaiser Permanente Colorado observed, \"I think CPEP has only become more vital in the world of healthcare today.\" \n\nCPEP offers comprehensive seminars and courses on a variety of topics, including communications, medical record keeping, prescribing prescription drugs and professional ethics. It also offers a Reentry to Clinical Practice program for those healthcare professionals who have voluntarily taken time off from practice and need to update their skills before returning to the workplace. \n\n\"Over the last 25 years, CPEP has been able to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing healthcare landscape and has successfully filled a significant need in the medical community,\" noted Korinek. \"CPEP helps prevent the loss of educated physicians from our healthcare system \u2013 a very valuable resource during a time of a considerable physician shortage.\" \n\nCPEP is also growing its operations to help meet the nation's increasing demand for more healthcare professionals. In 2014, CPEP opened a satellite office in Raleigh, North Carolina to better serve physicians and healthcare professionals across the U.S. and in Canada . \n\nIn July 2015 , CPEP formed a partnership with the Massachusetts Medical Society to ensure that programs are available for Massachusetts physicians who need to update or document their skills and competence as well as those who have taken extended time off from clinical practice. \n\nCPEP's 2014 Annual Report highlights some of its recent growth and accomplishments.

He considered the meeting as his \u201cdream\u201d and called Malala his \u201chero\u201d. \n\nJackky, who has appeared in films like \u201cF.A.L.T.U\u201d and \u201cWelcome to Karachi\u201d, earlier apologised to the 18-year-old by making a satirical six-minute video with live video entertainment platform #fame for writing her name incorrectly. \n\nThe response to the video was so overwhelming that it urged Malala and her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai to invite Jackky over to meet them. The video went viral on social media a few weeks ago on the occasion of Malala\u2019s 18th birthday on July 12. \n\n\u201cFor me things have come a full circle. From an auto-correct mistake to a birthday video tribute to a dream meeting with one of my heroes. Malala is not just an inspiration but a living example of how to fight with courage and determination,\u201d Jackky, who left for London on Monday, said in a statement. \n\n\u201cHer humility is touching and her sincerity is what makes her the leader that she is. Malala is a celebration of the human spirit and this meeting was an opportunity for me to experience that,\u201d he added. \n\nMalala says Jackky's video was the \u201cfirst thing\u201d she saw on her birthday, which \u201cmade my day.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe support encourages me to go on further as I know I'm not a lone girl in this mission of wanting girls to get quality education. I'm very thankful to Jackky and the team that made this video.\u201d Malala said. \n\nJackky also took to Twitter and shared a photograph of the meeting. He captioned it: \u201cFrom a mistake to a dream meeting! To my hero, thank you #Malala @ZiauddinY.\u201d \n\n\n\nJackky further tweeted, \"No family upholds the message of #BetiBachaoBetiPadhao better than @ZiauddinY & #Malala @PMOIndia @narendramodi\" \n\n\nMalala Yousafzai's message to India \nHe also shared a video message from Malala in which she can be heard saying: \u201cHello! Namaste and As-salamu alaykum to all my friends in India, all my brothers and sisters. I would like to say a big thank you to all of you for your kind support and encouragement to me and my campaign for education and it's your prayers and words that gives me strength to work even harder to ensure that every girl goes to school. \n\n\u201cIt's my ambition to work for that in Pakistan, in India and ensure that girls are working that hard and they will contribute to their society. So I'm putting forward to coming to India Inshallah and working there.

(Nasdaq:PSTI) (TASE:PSTI), a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products, reported yesterday financial results for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, and provides corporate and financial highlights for fiscal year 2015.\n\n\"During fiscal 2015 we executed our strategy to shorten the time to commercialization for PLX-PAD, our lead product, and significantly advanced the development of PLX-R18, our second product,\" said Zami Aberman, Pluristem's Chairman and CEO.\n\n\"We achieved a major milestone when our clinical development program for PLX-PAD in critical limb ischemia (CLI) was selected for Europe's Adaptive Pathways pilot project. Only a handful of programs were chosen worldwide. Pending a single successful Phase II trial, PLX-PAD could enter the European market in 2018 with conditional approval to treat a type of CLI. Another important milestone was safety clearance of PLX-PAD cells for use in clinical trials in Japan.\"\n\n\"We also advanced our U.S. program for PLX-R18 in the treatment of incomplete hematopoietic recovery following hematopoietic cell transplantation. This year we also announced an important new clinical finding from our Phase I\/II trial in muscle injury, suggesting that treatment with PLX-PAD could also significantly strengthen muscle force in the contralateral leg.\n\n\"During fiscal 2015, we strengthened our valued partnerships with United Therapeutics, Cha Bio and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and finished the fiscal year with a robust balance sheet. We look forward to a very productive fiscal 2016 on all fronts,\" Mr. Aberman concluded.\n\nClinical and Corporate Highlights for Fiscal Year 2015 Include:\n\nDuring fiscal 2015, Pluristem raised net cash of $17.2 million from issuance of common stock, and from exercises of outstanding warrants and options. The fundraise marked the accomplishment of a goal to increase US institutional ownership. In addition, the Company was awarded $2.9 million grant from the Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) of Israel's Ministry of Economy to support R&D programs, as well as a \"Smart Money\" grant from Israel's Ministry of the Economy to support marketing activities in Japan. As of June 30, 2015, Pluristem had $53.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted deposits and marketable securities. The Company expects this will support its activities for the next two years.\n\nAbout Pluristem Therapeutics Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. is a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy products. The Company has reported robust clinical trial data in multiple indications for its patented PLX (PLacental eXpanded) cells. The cells release a cocktail of therapeutic proteins in response to inflammation, ischemia, hematological disorders, and radiation damage. PLX cell products are grown using the Company's proprietary three-dimensional expansion technology. They are off-the-shelf, requiring no tissue matching prior to administration.\n\nPluristem has a strong intellectual property position; Company-owned, GMP-certified manufacturing and research facilities; strategic relationships with major research institutions; and a seasoned management team.\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and federal securities laws.

Flores' wife had been injured earlier and the 911 call was warranted, Henry said. But Flores hadn't used a knife against her, the attorney added. \n\nHenry also said a report that a baby had been injured was inaccurate. \n\nThe lawyer said he has yet to see a second video that also shows Flores' interaction with police and the moment he was shot. Authorities have not released the video to the media or public. \n\nA video that was posted online Monday by CNN affiliate KSAT shows Flores raising his arms as he stands in front of the officers. In that video, shot by a passing motorist, Flores' left arm is obscured by a pole. \n\nThe first video provides a stark, long-distance view of Flores. The second video is longer and is recorded from a different angle than the cell phone video that has been shown by the news media, Bexar County Sheriff Susan Pamerleau said Wednesday. \n\nThe sheriff said the video shows Flores with \"something in his hand.\" \n\n\"We believe it was a knife,\" Pamerleau told reporters. \n\nThe video, recorded by a neighbor, shows suspect Gilbert Flores acting \"wildly aggressive,\" a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The footage also shows the suspect charging one officer with a knife at one point and also shoving chairs at an officer, the source said. \n\nAuthorities have declined to comment on whether they found a knife at the scene. \n\nThe deputies, who are on administrative leave, are Greg Vasquez and Robert Sanchez, the sheriff's office has said. \n\nCNN's efforts to contact them have so far been unsuccessful. \n\nEach has been with the sheriff's office for more than a decade, Pamerleau said. Neither deputy involved in the shooting was wearing a body camera. \n\nFlores had previous run-ins with the law. He was cited for possession of marijuana in 1995, criminal trespassing and aggravated assault in 1999, and aggravated robbery in 2003. \n\nThe incident comes at a time when law enforcement officers are under scrutiny for how and when they resort to lethal force. The killings of several people by police over the past year have heightened tensions with the communities they serve, especially among minorities.","title":"Attorney: Texas man hit deputy with blunt end of knife","media-type":"News","source":"KODE TV","published":"2015-09-04T04:27:04Z"}

James Lewis, board chairman, said in explaining why he voted against the plan.\n\nBoard member Anthony Diina, the only vote in favor, said he supported the project, given the unusual shape of the lot and the failure of the existing zoning for the property. He referred to disparaging comments made by opponents of the store as \u201coutrageous\u201d and also was critical of those who criticized a community organization that supported the project.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the Zoning Board of Appeals capitulated to community opposition of a vocal minority,\u201d said attorney Corey A. Auerbach, representing Family Dollar.\n\nThe board was being asked to approve zoning variances addressing issues including signage, parking, building size and front and side yard placement. Auerbach argued that any new construction on the irregularly shaped site would face similar zoning issues.\n\nOpposition to the Family Dollar plan, nonetheless, was strong and vocal.\n\nSome 18 people lined up in the boardroom Wednesday to speak against the plan. Among them were John A. Ciminelli, of LPCiminelli, whose company is in the process of redeveloping the nearby Central Park Plaza into a $70 million apartment complex.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit here,\u201d Ciminelli said of the store, arguing that it goes against the city\u2019s efforts to promote a Green Code and transit-friendly development. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to walk out of the subway station and see this,\u201d he said.\n\nAssemblywoman Crystal D.

The zoning changes requested are severe, she said.\n\nMelissa Brown, of FLARE Community Center on nearby Leroy Avenue, said that the group distributed surveys and that only 46 people opposed the project. About 3,000 residents live in the immediate area, she said. She didn\u2019t have the surveys with her, but offered to provide them in the future. Wednesday, however, was the last of several Zoning Board meetings on the issue.\n\nPreviously, FLARE had been accused of supporting the project only after the developer offered a $100,000 donation.

India, government sources said, will now be looking to tie up the details with Wickremesinghe's \"national unity government\" and work towards finalising the agreement. \n \nWickremesinghe has also spoken in favour of a land bridge between Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Thalaimannar on Sri Lanka's western coast. More than the Sethusamudram project, which has now been almost given up, the idea of a land bridge has supporters in the Modi government. \n \nThe Sri Lankan PM is likely to have a lunch meeting with his counterpart Narendra Modi on September 15, aside from meetings with others in India's political leadership the same day. \n \nindianexpress.com\u00a0","title":"PM for land bridge between Rameswaram and Thalaimannar","media-type":"News","source":"Sri Lanka Daily News","published":"2015-09-07T22:03:53Z"}

PICTURE: AFP\/NIKOLAY DOYCHINOV  Source: AFP  \n        \n TWO weeks ago I wrote about compassion, and was lambasted by some readers.  \n   \nI expected that. \n\nMy subject was refugees, and how we should be taking them in, not turning them away. \n\nOn the day the piece appeared, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott bowed to public pressure, and agreed to accept a few thousand of those people fleeing from Islamic State in Syria. \n\nHowever, my Facebook news feed over the last week has been full of hatred and fear, both in Australia and in the UK. \n\nI\u2019ve found out that some of my friends, especially in the UK, are racist, sharing photos and videos purporting to show that the refugees are actually members of ISIS, put there to infiltrate other countries. \n \nOther pictures show families heading to a place called \u201cBenefits\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m disappointed in these friends. \n\nI thought they would show compassion. \n\nInstead they\u2019re showing fear and hatred. \n\nTheir fear is that Islam is suddenly going to take over the world. \n\nI find it sad that there\u2019s such intolerance. \n     \n ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE?

Therefore, if you wish to become part of society, learn the language and speak it. \n\n\u201cIf God or other parts of British culture offend you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your home, because God and Christian values are a major part of our culture.\u201d \n\nAs I wrote a couple of weeks ago, we\u2019re all migrants or refugees here in Cairns. \n\nI think back to my home town in the UK, which was host to French prisoners of war in the Napoleonic wars, and then in the Second World War, Polish refugees arrived. \n\nAfter they proved to be no danger, the French were allowed to wander around town freely, and after the Second World War, many of the Poles stayed, making great contributions to the town\u2019s industries and culture. \n     \n NOT THE PROBLEM: Refugees should not be treated with fear and hatred. PICTURE: DAVID RAMOS\/GETTY  Source:   \n    \nWhen we arrived in Australia back in 1992, we came here for a better life for our children, and part of the appeal was to live in a truly multicultural society. \n\nMy children have undoubtedly had a better life than they would have had in the UK. \n\nFinally, I\u2019ve had two GPs since moving to Cairns six years ago. \n\nThe first was from Iran, and my current GP is Irish. \n\nBoth migrants, and on Monday I saw a different doctor, who was obviously Indian or Pakistani, yet another migrant, and I was happy to put my healthcare into his hands. \n\nI reiterate, if it wasn\u2019t for migrants and refugees, Cairns would be a very different place than it is today. \n\nA friend works for a Catholic aid agency in town. \n\nOne of their core values is: \u201cSolidarity \u2026 everyone belongs to one human family, regardless of their national, religious, ethnic, economic, political and ideological differences.\u201d \n\nSounds good to me. \n\nWe only live once, let\u2019s try and live that life in peace, not war. \n\nwww.christopherellis.net","title":"Let\u2019s try to live together in peace","media-type":"News","source":"Cairns Post","published":"2015-09-22T20:06:04Z"}

I've been in a lot of pantos and I don't think it's offensive at all. \n\n'The excuse of 'people' being uncomfortable is a poor one - I doubt they've questioned the audience about whether or not they think the word dwarf is offensive. \n\n'I think it's all a smokescreen anyway. \n\n'The profit margins for pantos are not very big and it's obviously much cheaper to involve schoolchildren than it is to pay lots of professional short actors.' \n   \nActor\u00a0Warwick Davis and Lizzie Jay-Hughes as Snow White 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. He has branded the decision 'patronising' \n\nA spokeswoman for the council run theatre, where the panto will run, said the word dwarf is 'generally not a word that people feel comfortable with'. \n\nBut regular pantomime-goers have reacted with anger to the move.\u00a0 \n\nFather-of-two Mark Chapman, 27, from Coalville, said: 'How can you have Snow White and the Seven Dwarves without dwarves? It's utterly ridiculous. \n\n'You could understand kids playing the roles at a school pantomime but not in a big theatre. It is just political correctness gone mad. \n\n'You cannot just rebrand a children's classic at the risk of offending somebody. It is outrageous.' \n\nDarryl Birch, 34, added: 'If anything, it is more offensive to remove the term dwarf. What message does that send out? \n\n'Even if it is cost-cutting, it is still really lame. Pantomimes are supposed to be fun and magical and this is far from it. \n\n'I can't understand it. Their excuses are all poor and I think they ought to reconsider.' \n\nThe theatre is charging \u00a315 for an adult ticket to see the popular fairytale, written in 1812 by the Brothers Grimm and made into a feature length animation by Walt Disney in 1937. \n\nThe production, which runs from December 12 to January 4 next year stars Sherrie Hewson of Benidorm fame and children's presenter Justin Fletcher. \n\nThe title role of Snow White will be played by Sarah Accomando and Britain's Got Talent finalist Jon Clegg will also be appearing on stage.\u00a0 \n\nWillow Management, an agency representing short actors in the UK, also criticised the decision to axe the term 'dwarf' from the performance. \n\nThe company, which was set up by Warwick Davis in 1995, claimed the move will 'take away the magic' from the pantomime and leave dwarf actors out of work. \n\nCo-director Peter Burroughs, 68, said: 'It is a cheap way of doing it. \n\n'They can employ kids but that takes the living away from some of the dwarf actors so that is the great sadness here. \n\n'It is wrong. I don't see that the term dwarf as offensive. I am a dwarf actor myself and I have never had any trouble. \n\n'People are often overjoyed with meeting the dwarf actors at these sort of shows. \n\n'We have never come across problems with people being uncomfortable before. \n\n'Everybody should be relaxed at these shows. We all live perfectly well nowadays so there should be no stigma. \n   \nA promotional poster for the performance at De Monfort Hall in Leicester in 1986\/87 contains the word 'dwarfs' \n\n'As one myself, I don't mind the term dwarf. \n\n'It can take away the magic from pantomimes. People expect magic, they expect to see all sorts of things at these shows. \n\n'I think it is a way of the theatre getting out of it, so they don't upset people.'\u00a0 \n\nLucy Moore, commenting on De Montfort Hall's Facebook page, wrote: 'I am all for not offending people, but this is clearly a case of political correctness going slightly mad. \n\n'This musical has been around for about 80 years and loved by millions - for De Montfort Hall to change the name now is utterly ridiculous, in my opinion. I can't imagine they have had a single complaint since announcing the show. It's pretty patronising.' \n\nSue Bourton, of Leicester, also writing on Facebook, said: 'I am a parent of a child with restricted growth (or to put it plainly a Dwarf). The term Dwarf is totally fine, as is little person. The term that is derogatory is 'midget' and this should never be used. \n\n'I was hoping that the show would use people with restricted growth to play the seven dwarves as that is how it should be, not to use children, that in itself is wrong. De Montfort Hall you have really got it wrong here, where will you draw the line? They should rethink this decision and revoke it, it's just plain silly!' \n\nAntonia Doyle wrote: 'Have a word with yourself, De Montfort Hall. By not having the seven dwarfs means that you're putting seven little men\/women out if a job this year. \n\n'Stop being a killjoy and just stick by plan A, sack the idiot who came up with this ludicrous idea and get a life rather than bringing unnecessary disappointment to the kids and making an issue out of something that isn't.' \n\nAnd Michelle Acton said: 'Come on De Montfort Hall, get a grip! You're just making yourselves look stupid and spoiling it for the innocent children who know and enjoy the story for what it is. Political correctness gone totally wrong - pathetic.'\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0","title":"Oh, no they didn't!

{"id":"a577c48b-c636-4259-a2ab-ce4b8fba9fc8","content":"Because of John Wayne Gacy, John Doe No. 89 now has a name. \n \nIt's Andy Drath, who as a teenage boy fit the profile of many of the serial killer's victims. Authorities don't think Drath was one of them, though investigators looking into Gacy's past did manage to put two and two together in a major breakthrough in a 36-year-old cold case and major relief to Drath's family. \n\n\"You should never lose hope in finding your loved one.\" said Dr. Willia Wertheimer, Drath's half-sister who submitted DNA that proved pivotal. \"... John Doe No. 89 now will come home to his kid sister with his own name -- Andy.\" \n\nA ward of Illinois' Department of Children and Family Services, Drath was a 16-year-old boy when he was last seen in late 1978 or early the next year, the Cook County, Illinois, Sheriff's Office announced Wednesday. He'd gone west to San Francisco, hoping to have his guardianship transferred there. \n\nIt was in that Northern California city, in June 1979, that police found a male's body with multiple gunshot wounds in a homicide. \n\nThey didn't know who he was, much less who killed him. And, according to authorities, his case went cold. \n\nAt least until Gacy entered the picture. \n\nGacy investigators sought help \n\nGacy was arrested in December 1978, and about 14 months later, he went on trial. It ended with his conviction for raping and killing 33 boys and young men who he had lured into his home over a span of six years. To get them there, he'd promised them construction jobs, drugs and alcohol or by posing as a police officer or by offering money for sex. \n\nTwenty-eight bodies were found in and around the serial killer's Chicago home, most of them in a 40-foot crawl space beneath his house and garage. Four others had been thrown into the Des Plaines River. \n\nYet while authorities believed and the jury agreed that Gacy was responsible for all these deaths, that didn't mean they knew who all of them were. \n\nThat was the case in 2011, seven years after the serial killer was executed, when the Cook County Sheriff's Office launched a new effort to identify eight of the victims. \n\nThis time, they'd use new technology to obtain DNA profiles, an effort they hoped would provide closure to families looking for their loved ones for decades. \n\nSheriff: Case shows 'never give up' \n\nOnly of those eight Gacy victims, William George Bundy, has been positively identified as a result. \n\nThe Cook County Sheriff's Office said in a news release Wednesday that 12 cases have been closed as a result of Gacy-related leads, in part because relatives of missing people from that era and area came forward with new information at the urging of authorities. \n\nIn five cases, once-missing people were found alive and were reunited with their families. Two others died of natural causes after they were reported missing. And there was some resolution for four other instances -- Drath being one of them. \n\nWertheimer, his maternal half-sister, reached out to the Sheriff's Office and submitted DNA thinking that Drath -- as a young white male from Chicago's North Side -- fit the profile of Gacy's other victims. \n\nInvestigators weren't able to link her to any of Gacy's known victims, but her information was uploaded to a federal DNA database. DNA from Darth's tissue samples was uploaded in late 2014, though it wasn't until May 2015 that this was matched with Wertheimer. Dental records and a tattoo with the name \"Andy\" confirmed the connection. \n\nWertheimer learned of the link on September 10, and San Francisco police are now trying to find the killer -- not of John Doe No. 89 but of Andre \"Andy\" Drath. \n\n\"I'm thankful that Andy Drath will be brought home and laid to rest with the dignity he deserves,\" Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart said. \"This breakthrough illustrates that we should never give up on a cold case, no matter how hopeless it appears.\"","title":"Gacy probe spurs 36-year-old cold case breakthrough","media-type":"News","source":"WLWT","published":"2015-09-23T22:37:58Z"}

Rocco Fazzari and Denis Carnahan with apologies to ABBA. \n PT1M14S   620  349    \nEvery Prime Minister arrives with a history of disputes with other powerful figures, and Malcolm Turnbull has more than his fair share. Here's his top five: \n\n1.  Rupert Murdoch \n \nPM Malcolm Turnbull wants to scrap the archaic Knights and Dames system. Photo: Rob Homer  \n  \nRupert Murdoch media mogul and prolific tweeter, has made no secret that he preferred Tony Abbott as leader of the Liberal Party. Murdoch's tabloids made no secret of it either. \"Malcolm Turncoat,\" said the Herald Sun , \"Smiling Assassin,\" said the Daily Telegraph after the party room spill. \n \nBut the problems between Turnbull and Murdoch run deeper than a preference for Abbott's conservatism. As communications minister, Turnbull proposed an overhaul of the media ownership laws that would have permitted media companies to extend their geographic reach beyond 75 per cent and move into radio, television and newspapers. (They are currently restricted to two.) News Corp Australia opposed the changes because it does not include changes to the anti-siphoning rules, which are designed to keep important sporting programs on free-to-air television. This rule crimps the Murdoch and Telstra-owned pay TV service, Foxtel, which would no doubt use exclusive sport to lift subscriptions. \n\nAbbott parked Turnbull's media reforms and they have not seen the light of day. Will Turnbull now elevate them to a reform priority? \n \n Illustration: David Rowe. \n  \n2. Alan Jones \u2013 radio broadcaster \n\nBacktrack to June 5 last year when broadcaster Alan Jones lectured and harangued Turnbull over his loyalty on air. It was electrifying radio. It opened with Jones insisting Turnbull repeat an affirmation of loyalty to Abbott and went downhill from there. \n\nJones: \"You have no hope ever of being the leader. You've got to get that into your head. No hope ever. But because of that you're happy to throw a few bombs around that might blow up Abbott a bit.\" \n\nTurnbull : \"Well that's what you're saying. And that is what Andrew Bolt is saying. And it is doing the Labor Party's work.\" \n\nMaybe time heals all wounds, but the conservative commentators \u2013 Jones especially \u2013 might have to eat a large piece of humble pie. Will Turnbull become the first leader who doesn't feel the need to tug the forelock to Jones? \n\n3. Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals \n\nMany senior Nationals deeply dislike Turnbull over the way he acted on carbon pricing when he was opposition leader in 2009, but none more so than Barnaby Joyce. One sees himself as the smartest guy in the room; the other is a clever bush politician. \n\nIt was Joyce who declared in 2009, that Turnbull \"is not my leader\", after Turnbull revealed in an interview he had been duchessed by the ALP to join them. \n\nImmediately after the ballot this week Joyce held a late-night press conference to remind Turnbull that he should take account of his party's \"key values\". \n\nExpect some sparks between Joyce and Turnbull, particularly if Joyce replaces Warren Truss as leader in the future. \n\n4. Monarchists and conservatives \n\nThe distrust of Turnbull runs particularly deep among monarchists, who are well represented among the conservative faction of the parliamentary Liberal Party. The Australian Republican Movement gave Turnbull his platform into public life. He then knocked off a leading monarchist, Peter King, who was in the way of his running for Wentworth. \n\nKing later claimed in Parliament that Turnbull told him to \"f--- off and get out of my way\". \n\nEven though Turnbull has declared he's not about to reignite a debate over Australia becoming a republic, there are many who remember a brasher Turnbull, who was prepared to ridicule their stance of opposing the republic. \n\n5. The Packer camp \n\nAustralia's scariest media mogul, Kerry Packer, has shuffled off his mortal coil and Canadian media mogul Conrad Black has lost his knighthood and fortune. But back in 1991 Packer was incandescent with rage at Turnbull for derailing the Tourang bid for Fairfax. Packer was forced to pull out after diary notes put together by Packer executive Trevor Kennedy were sent to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, recording that despite assurances, Packer planned to have a big say in how Fairfax was run.

Marshall Islands Foreign Minister Tony de Brum has slammed Immigration Minister Peter Dutton for joking that rising seas will swamp low-lying Pacific islands, inviting him to watch waves that pound his home and terrify his grandchildren. The Marshalls, a series of coral atolls and islands, is highly vulnerable to climate change and has suffered devastating storm surges and drought in recent years.\n\nOn Friday Mr Dutton was that \"time doesn't mean anything when you're about to ... have water lapping at your door\", in reference to time delays during a Pacific leaders forum Mr Abbott attended this week.\n\nMr de Brum took to Twitter to denounce Mr Dutton, saying \"insensitivity knows no bounds in the big polluting island down [south]\".\n\n\"Next time waves are battering my home [and] my grandkids are scared, I'll ask Peter Dutton to come over, and we'll see if he is still laughing,\" he wrote, adding he was \"dismayed\" by the remarks.\n\nHe said the best way for Australia to \"show it cares\" is to bring a \"proper\" emissions reduction target to Paris climate talks later this year.\n\nAustralia has pledged to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, based on 2005 levels. Just days ago at a meeting of Pacific leaders, despite fears that the survival of island nations was threatened.\n\nBoth Mr Abbott and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key rejected pleas by smaller Pacific nations to go beyond a commitment to limiting the global temperature rise to 2 degrees.\n\nSome Pacific leaders have criticised Australia for prioritising economic growth over the future of their people. The leaders The Marshalls are among five island nations to join calls for a global moratorium on new coalmines \u2013 an industry Mr Abbott has described as \"good for humanity\".\n\nMr Dutton refused to explain his remark on Friday, saying it was part of a private conversation with Mr Abbott.\n\nMr Dutton's joke came as the leaders waited for ethnic and community groups to settle in for a meeting about Syrian refugees.\n\nThe exchange was cut short when Social Services Minister Scott Morrison told Mr Abbott and Mr Dutton that a microphone was recording their conversation.\n\nMr Abbott said on Thursday he has a \"very good story to tell\" on climate change and Pacific leaders \"should be reassured by the seriousness with which Australia is approaching this issue\".\n\nPacific-based climate action advocates from the group 350.org have written to Mr Abbott, calling on him to apologise to Pacific nations and saying Mr Dutton should resign.\n\n\"For the Pacific, climate change is about survival. We find your government's inaction deeply disturbing and your colleague's disregard for our people deeply offensive,\" Papua New Guinea coordinator Arianne Kassman wrote.\n\nMr de Brum has previously warned that damage from climate extremes was already lashing his nation and crippling its ability to develop.\n\nHe said the Marshalls wanted to \"practise what we preach\" on halting climate change and would seek to reduce methane emissions from waste, cut diesel use and embrace more solar to meet its goals.\n\nThe president of Kiribati has labelled Mr Dutton as \"morally irresponsible\" for making a \"vulgar\" joke about the rising sea levels, the ABC reports.\n\nAnote Tong said the minister should \"search his own soul\".\n\n\"What kind of a person is he? As long as there is this kind of attitude, this kind of arrogance in any position of leadership, we will continue to have a lot of tension,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"I hope this doesn't reflect the deeper feelings ... about this issue because it's a serious issue for many people on this planet.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"'Waves are battering my home': Marshall Islands Foreign Minister slams Peter Dutton after climate joke","media-type":"News","source":"Wingham Chronicle","published":"2015-09-11T15:45:07Z"}

The event was held in partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund. \n\nAsked by a Cuban student about the example of his leadership, Francis said, \"I will tell you one thing, a good leader is one who is capable of bringing up other leaders. If a leader wants to lead alone, he is a tyrant. True leadership is fruitful. Each one of you has the seed of leadership.\" \n\nHe added, \"The leaders of today will not be here tomorrow. If they do not plant the seed of leadership in others, they are worthless. They are dictators.\" \n\nFrancis, the first pope from Latin America, earned praise from both U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro for helping restart relations between the neighboring countries. \n\nIn July, the two countries reopened embassies in Havana and Washington. \n\nPope Francis' whirlwind tour to Cuba and the United States begins Saturday, when he arrives in Havana for a trip that includes mass at Revolution Square, a meeting with government officials and a visit to the Shrine of Our Lady of Charity del Cobre, the island's patron saint. \n\nThe Pope will be the third consecutive leader of the Roman Catholic Church to visit Cuba. St. John Paul II stopped there for several days in 1998, and Pope Benedict XVI visited for three days in 2012. \n\nRelations between the Vatican and Cuba, strained during the 49-year rule of communist dictator Fidel Castro, have improved since the younger Castro replaced his sickly brother as president. \n\nCuba was officially atheist from 1962-1992, and an annual State Department report issued last year said religious activity there is only allowed \"if explicitly authorized\" by the government. The Catholic Church estimates between 60% and 70% of Cubans are baptized. \n\nAnother Cuban student Friday urged the Pope to remember the poor and marginalized and to pray for a lifting of the longstanding U.S. embargo against Cuba. \n\nFrancis said he would do \"all that is possible\" to \"build bridges\" and foster communication leading to friendship. \n\nPrevious popes, such as St. John Paul II, who was raised in communist Poland, had little love for totalitarian states but believed that sanctions impoverished ordinary Cubans and isolated a government that might be won over through careful diplomacy.","title":"Pope Francis criticizes 'dictators.'

(Nasdaq:BLPH), a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company, announced that an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial sponsored by the Company was presented today at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse\u00ae \n\nIn the trial, 6 subjects (3 male and 3 female between the ages of 65-79) with pulmonary hypertension associated with COPD on long-term oxygen therapy were given an acute dose of INOpulse inhaled nitric oxide. Following treatment, the subjects underwent functional respiratory imaging to determine the geometry of their lungs, airway and pulmonary vascular structures.\n\nIn all of the subjects, administration of inhaled nitric oxide resulted in increased blood volume in the blood vessels in the lungs while also preserving oxygen saturation following treatment. Anecdotally, all patients in the trial reported having felt better following the treatment.\n\nJonathan Peacock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Bellerophon Therapeutics, stated, \"We continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making in the development of INOpulse as a potential treatment for pulmonary hypertension. This late-breaker session at the ERS Congress builds on earlier studies indicating that INOpulse has the potential to reduce pulmonary hypertension in COPD patients. In the next several months, we plan to test the effect of reducing pulmonary hypertension on exercise capacity for these patients.\"\n\nAbout Pulmonary Hypertension \n\nPulmonary hypertension is a rare lung disorder in which the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs become narrowed, making it difficult for blood to flow through the vessels. As a result, the blood pressure in these arteries -- called pulmonary arteries -- rises far above normal levels. This abnormally high pressure strains the right ventricle of the heart, causing it to expand in size. Overworked and enlarged, the right ventricle gradually becomes weaker and loses its ability to pump enough blood to the lungs. This could lead to the development of right heart failure.\n\nAbout Bellerophon \n\nBellerophon Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company focused on developing innovative therapies at the intersection of drugs and devices that address significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary and cardiac diseases. The Company is currently developing two product candidates under its INOpulse\u00ae program, a proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide delivery device. The first is for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), for which the Company intends to commence Phase 3 clinical trials in 2015, and the other for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PH-COPD), which is in Phase 2 development. The Company's plans also call for the completion of further work on the use of INOpulse to treat pulmonary hypertension associated with COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis during 2016. Additionally, management is reviewing alternative paths forward for its Bioabsorbable Cardiac Matrix program.

But now it\u2019s playing, not in theaters, but all over mainstream media, with something like rave reviews from the president and his administration. \n \nThe theme of the movie is that there is an epidemic of racist white policemen, gunning down innocent black people. The movie\u2019s message, implicit but unambiguous, is that the police must be restrained from vigorous enforcement of the law. \n \nThat was the message of the Black Power movement half a century ago, and it is the message of the Black Lives Matter movement today. \n \nConsider the BLM demands. Some are anodyne. Who is against \u201cbetter training for police officers\u201d? We already have independent (usually elected) prosecutors. The law already \u201climit(s) the use of force by police.\u201d \n \nBut the most important BLM demand is the first: \u201cEnd \u2018broken windows\u2019 policing.\u201d The evidence is that this is already happening \u2014 at the cost of black lives. \n \nEven the New York Times has noticed. So far this year, murders are up 76 percent in Milwaukee, 60 percent in St. Louis, 56 percent in Baltimore, and 44 percent in Washington, D.C. \n \nWhile murders are up, arrests are down. There is, as Manhattan Institute scholar Heather Mac Donald writes, a \u201creluctance to act [that] is affecting police departments across the country, as virtually every tool in an officer\u2019s tool chest \u2014 from traffic stops to public-order maintenance \u2014 is vilified as racist.\u201d \n The message of the Black Power movement half a century ago\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0is the message of the Black Lives Matter movement today.  \nIn Baltimore, the death of Freddie Gray after slipping into a coma in a police van in April inspired mass protests and apparently prompted police to abandon active patrolling; arrests suddenly plunged 60 percent below 2014 rates. There were 58 murders in Baltimore up to April 15 this year, up from 49. From April 16 to August 23, there were 157 murders in the city, up from 88 in 2014, with 45 murders in July alone. Almost all of the victims were black. \n \nThose insisting that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d \u2014 and shouting down politicians such as former Baltimore Mayor Martin O\u2019Malley for saying \u201call lives matter\u201d \u2014 are apparently unfazed by this shocking increase in black deaths. \n \nSome BLM activists go farther, calling for murder of police. Some wear shirts with the words \u201cAssata taught me\u201d \u2014 a reference to the woman, now a fugitive in Cuba, convicted in 1977 of murdering a New Jersey state trooper. \n \nBLM activists marching outside the Minnesota State Fair chanted, \u201cPigs in a blanket. Fry \u2019em like bacon.\u201d That was a day after the Democratic National Committee, meeting in Minneapolis, approved a resolution \u201ccondemning extrajudicial killings and affirming black lives matter\u201d and hailing \u201ca generation of young African-Americans who feel totally dismissed and unheard as they are crushed between unlawful street violence and unjust police violence.\u201d \n \n\u201cWe need to start killing these officers,\u201d shouted a crowd as police arrested a violent woman in Madison, Wisconsin \u2014 an ultraliberal university town where, incidentally, blacks are arrested at ten times the rate of whites. \n \nAcross the country some people seem to be acting on that advice. Last December, after the protests of the death in custody of a man on Staten Island, two New York Police Department officers were shot and killed in Brooklyn. On August 2, a policeman was killed during a routine traffic stop in Memphis. On August 29, a sheriff\u2019s deputy was gunned down in Houston.

(AP) \u2014 California fire officials said a wildfire north of San Francisco destroyed another 162 homes, raising the number of homes destroyed to 1,050 and making it the third worst wildfire in the state's history. \n \nThe tally announced on Sunday brought the total number of homes destroyed in two wildfires burning in Northern California to nearly 1,600, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. Those fires killed five people, and on Sunday authorities announced that a body was found in the ashes of a wildfire in Monterey County that destroyed or damaged 10 homes. \n \nFirefighters found the man's body inside a charred vehicle after the fire began Saturday near the community of Jamesburg. Investigators were investigating his death as a possible suicide, Monterey County Sheriff's spokesman John Thornburg said. \n \nA firefighter lost his home while battling the blaze, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reported. \n \n\"I was out fighting the fire on the other end, and then my whole place burned down,\" Bob Eaton, a volunteer firefighter with the Cachagua Fire Protection District, told the newspaper. \"My parent's house, right below me, it burned down. And my neighbors up on top, their place is burned down.\" \n \nEaton said firefighters' quick response to the blaze wasn't enough to save some of the homes. \"It just went so damn fast,\" he said of the spread of the fire. \n \nThe blaze was one of 10 active wildfires Sunday, most of them in Northern California that continue to threaten thousand more homes. \n \nDamage-assessment teams have counted 1,050 homes burned in Lake County, many of them in the town of Middletown, CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said. \n \nThe teams have completed about 80 percent of damage assessment, focusing largely on homes, Berlant said. They have not determined how many additional structures, such as sheds, barns and other outbuildings, were destroyed. \n \nThe fire, which killed at least three people and charred 118 square miles was 69 percent contained. About 6,500 homes remained threatened by the fire, considered the third worst fire in California history based on total structures burned. A 1991 fire in the Oakland Hills ranks as California's deadliest fire and its worst in the number of homes destroyed. \n \nMeanwhile, another 545 homes were destroyed by a separate blaze that killed at least two people and that has burned 110 square miles in the Sierra Nevada foothills. That blaze was 72 percent contained Sunday. Even though it continued to threaten thousands of structures, all evacuation orders were lifted. \n \n(","title":"Northern California wildfires destroy nearly 1,600 homes","media-type":"News","source":"KOBTV New Mexico's NBC News","published":"2015-09-21T06:00:53Z"}

The Wildcats had only allowed 110 yards per game before playing the Cardinals. DN PHOTO ALLISON COFFIN \n\u00a0  \nOn the surface, Ball State's 24-19 loss at No. 17 Northwestern doesn't seem like a bad one based on the Wildcats' prowess. \n\nNorthwestern was a clear favorite in the game, and many people probably picked Ball State\u00a0to get blown out. \n\nBall State controlled most of the game, however,\u00a0and either\u00a0tied or outscored Northwestern in three quarters on Sept. 26. Missed chances and the Wildcats' big third quarter doomed the Cardinals in the loss. \n \n\u201cAgain, not a bad effort by any means,\" head coach Pete Lembo said.\u00a0\"But one where we needed to make a few more plays in six or seven different situations.\" \n\nAfter taking an early 3-0 lead against the nation's No. 10-ranked defense coming in, Ball State got the ball back after a turnover on downs. They pushed the ball down the field, but freshman Morgan Hagee missed a 43-yard field goal. \n\nHagee missed two field goals in the game, finishing 2-of-4. \n\nJust a few drives later, the Cardinals were knocking on the door again. A 34-yard James Gilbert run took the ball to the 4-yard line to end the first quarter. \n\nBut quarterback Riley Neal, in\u00a0the first start of his career, fumbled the snap while attempting to hand it off, and the Wildcats recovered \n\nAnother chance to extend the lead, another costly mistake. Neal agreed with Lembo that it may have been the difference in the game. \n\n\u201cIf I [didn't] fumble that ball on the 5-yard line,\u00a0we\u2019d have more points on the board,\u201d Neal said. \u201cWe left plenty of points on the field where it should have been a different ball game.\u201d \n\nBall State's defense stood up to Northwestern by forcing four turnovers. They gave up a big touchdown in the second quarter and 17 points in the third, but gave the offense good chances to put points on the board. \n\nThe Wildcats had turned the ball over just three times coming into the game. \n\n\u201cOur defense played well enough that if were able to get those 14 points, [we'd be] a little bit happier right now\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a lot happier right now,\u201d Lembo said. \n\nStill, after the Wildcats' big third quarter, the Cardinals had their chances.\u00a0 \n\nThey put together one\u00a0touchdown drive in the second half, but failed to take advantage of short field on a few occasions. \n\nWhile there were positives\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Ball State fared better offensively against Northwestern than Stanford or Duke\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the combination of mistakes added up in defeat. \n\nLembo knows this was a game that his team\u00a0had every opportunity to win, but couldn't pull through.\u00a0The Cardinals (2-2, 1-0)\u00a0can take the positives from this game, however, and carry them into the rest of their Mid-American Conference schedule. \n\nBall State will face another tough test next week\u00a0against Toledo, who sits right outside the top\u00a025 after a 3-0 start with wins against Arkansas and Iowa State.","title":"Turnovers, mistakes take away from strong performance","media-type":"News","source":"Ball State Daily News","published":"2015-09-27T22:49:30Z"}
{"id":"42acf682-6bd9-4c47-a994-a4c1cfa4e61a","content":"WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal appeals court is blocking Samsung Electronics from selling some of its older smartphones in the U.S. in the latest twist to a long-running legal battle over how much of the devices' technology was copied from Apple's iPhone. \n\nThe ruling issued Thursday by the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington vindicates Apple, but might not hurt Samsung too much. That's because it applies to phones that are no longer popular. \n\nThe most recent phone affected by the injunction, the Galaxy S3, was released in 2012 \u2014 long enough ago to be eclipsed by slicker smartphones in the rapidly evolving market for mobile technology. Samsung recently began selling the Galaxy S6, which was unaffected by Thursday's decision. \n\nSamsung could also revise the features covered by the injunction, something that the company has previously indicated it might do if prodded by the courts. \n\nApple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. have been locked in a bitter feud for years over the patents covering a variety of features commonly used in many smartphones. \n\nThe acrimony dates back to the reign of Apple's late CEO Steve Jobs, who contended that Google had ripped off the iPhone's innovations to use in Android, a free mobile operating system that Samsung uses in its smartphones. Samsung emerged as Apple's biggest rival in the smartphone market, making it the target of a legal onslaught that has continued long after Jobs' death nearly four years ago. \n\nJuries in two separate federal court trials in San Jose, California, decided some of the features in Samsung's phones and tablets infringed on Apple's patents covering iPhone innovations. Apple has been awarded more than $600 million in damages so far, but Samsung is still pursuing appeals that could reduce the amount owed. \n\nIn a 2-1 vote, the appeals court issuing Thursday's injunction concluded Apple was being harmed by Samsung's infringement on patents for iPhone's slide-to-lock screen and auto-correct feature. The court also concluded that protecting Apple's intellectual rights wouldn't harm the public welfare. \n\n\"Apple does not seek to enjoin the sale of lifesaving drugs, but to prevent Samsung from profiting from the unauthorized use of infringing features in its cellphones and tablets,\" wrote U.S. Federal Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore in the majority opinion.","title":"Court blocks US sales of old Samsung phones in Apple battle","media-type":"News","source":"Boston Herald","published":"2015-09-17T21:49:05Z"}

Rudolph \n\nJourney to Space: The Exhibition offers hands-on and multimedia experiences \n\nGuests will get a hands-on, climb-aboard experience at what it takes to live and work in space. The exhibition examines the extraordinary environment of space, including the very real dangers astronauts face during their mission above-Earth and the adaptations that engineers have developed to help them survive. Visitors will learn about the vacuum of space, radiation, meteoroids, and temperature extremes, while getting a look at all of the ways in which the forbidding environment of space can challenge human exploration.\n\nGuests will find hands-on activities to explore the science of getting to space. This includes learning about \"weightlessness\" and how it affects the body during a long-term space mission. An experiment with water rockets, varying the amount of air and water used as fuel, will allow them to observe the physics of the launch. Another interactive uses drop towers, which lift items up high and drop them in a free-fall, to demonstrate how familiar objects behave differently in the weightless environment of space.\n\nVisitors will experience the sights, sounds, and smells on board an orbiting space station like the International Space Station (ISS), and try their hands at some of the engineering feats that support astronauts who live in space. Through games, multimedia components, and interactive exhibits, guests will find out how astronauts eat, sleep, and even use the restroom in space. They'll encounter firsthand the difficulties of working in space \u2013 from operating a robotic arm like astronauts on the space shuttle, to managing the limited power supply available to keep life support systems running, to discovering why working in a pressurized glove in the vacuum of space is so difficult.\n\nJourney to Space: The Exhibition features a full-scale replica of the Destiny Lab, the primary research facility for U.S. payloads on the ISS. With its rotating mechanism, guests stepping into the Destiny Lab will have their sense of orientation challenged as they get a virtual tour from astronauts who have worked there.\n\nAlong the way, they will see incredible footage from past missions of crews living and working in space, as well as interviews in which astronauts reflect on the trials and accomplishments of their unique line of work.\n\nJourney to Space: The Exhibition was designed and developed by the Science Museum of Minnesota \n\nJourney to Space 3D film unveils new era of deep space exploration\n\nNarrated by film and television legend Sir Patrick Stewart \n\nThrough visually stunning imagery, and in collaboration with leading space experts, Journey to Space 3D showcases the exciting plans NASA and the space community are developing and the challenges they must overcome to carry out future missions that once seemed impossible, like landing astronauts on Mars. It calls attention to the reality that the space program did not die with the end of the Shuttle Program -- it is vibrantly alive today. \n\n\"No longer science fiction, a human mission to Mars is in the planning stages, and major steps are being taken to make it a reality within a generation,\" said Bob Kresser \n\nLooking ahead to the future, the film explores the newest technology in space exploration:\n\nJourney to Space 3D gives a fitting tribute to the Space Shuttle Program and the 355 astronauts who flew on the 135 Shuttle missions. This historical chapter in the film reveals how the Shuttle took many of the big steps that helped us understand how to live and operate in space. In fact, the lessons learned during those many steps that have enabled the future missions being planned today.\n\nThe film also gives a strong overview of the Shuttle's last major project \u2013 the launch and assembly of the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is a joint collaboration of 15 nations, operating 24\/7 and providing a true home and science lab in space. While ISS crews' tours of duty have averaged six months in the past, NASA began one-year duration missions this year. Researchers expect the one-year mission to yield beneficial knowledge on the medical, psychological and biomedical challenges explorers may face as they venture to an asteroid, Mars and beyond.\n\nJourney to Space 3D provides a timely review of how NASA has been transitioning from the end of the Space Shuttle Era to a much more ambitious future that will forever change how we live and operate in space as a species. \n\nJourney to Space 3D, presented by Toyota and Boeing, is a co-production of K2 Films and Giant Screen films, written and directed by Mark Krenzien \n\nAbout K2 Films \n\nRecognized as leaders in Giant Screen documentary cinema, K2 Films, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of K2 Communications (K2), brings a wealth of success and experience in all aspects of production, global distribution and marketing.

I've just been having the best time doing this,\" said Abby Mueller. \"As soon as I got the audition, I called Jessie. I was like, 'I've got a funny story for you.'\" \n\nJessie and Abby Mueller are just the tip of the talented, Chicago-based Mueller family. Their brothers, Matt and Andrew, as well as their parents, Roger Mueller and Jill Shellabarger, are all actors. \n\n\"Beautiful\" director Marc Bruni said Abby, who graduated from Indiana University and has been on Broadway in \"Kinky Boots,\" earned the job with her skills. \n\n\"We did not set out to specifically cast within the Mueller family. Abby is an extraordinary talent in her own right,\" he said. \n\n\"She is creating her own version of Carole that has all of the emotional resonance and all of the truthful acting that comes with the Mueller family and their amazing accessibility of emotion.\" \n\nThe tour kicks off in Providence, Rhode Island, on Tuesday. It makes stops in North Carolina, Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Texas, California and Colorado. \n\nOne of the tour's highlights for Mueller will be spending the holidays and New Year's Eve in Chicago. \"It's going to be awesome. I'm thrilled,\" she said. \"I haven't been home for Christmas in years.\" \n\nThe musical tells the story of King and her first husband, Gerry Goffin, who together composed some of the greatest pop singles of the early 1960s, including The Shirelles' \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,\" the Drifters' \"Up on the Roof,\" Bobby Vee's \"Take Good Care of My Baby\" and Little Eva's \"The Loco-Motion.\" \n\nBook writer Douglas McGrath intertwines the story of King and Goffin with that of their friends and avid competitors, the songwriting team of Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, which opens another treasure trove of pop hits like \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" and \"Walking in the Rain.\" \n\nAudience members get some history -- and some killer tunes. \"You learn something and you have your heart warmed. And you also have this catalog of music that is just unparalleled,\" said Bruni. \n\nIt will be the first time on the road for Mueller, but not for Liam Tobin, who plays Gerry Goffin.

{"id":"459c0228-5eb8-4a0a-9e76-280da3de6303","content":"Deferral follows outcome of third PJM capacity auction \n\nCHICAGO--(EON: Enhanced Online News \n\n\u201cWhile Quad Cities and Byron remain economically challenged, we are encouraged by the results of the recent capacity auctions. The new market reforms help to recognize the unique value of always-on nuclear power, while preserving the reliability of our electric system\u201d\n\nExelon intends to bid Quad Cities, Byron, Three Mile Island and all eligible nuclear plants into the 2019-2020 PJM capacity auction next year. The decision to defer retirement decisions comes after rigorous analysis of the present and future economics of the plants, taking into consideration the constructive market trends stemming from the PJM capacity auction reforms. \n\n\u201cWhile Quad Cities and Byron remain economically challenged, we are encouraged by the results of the recent capacity auctions. The new market reforms help to recognize the unique value of always-on nuclear power, while preserving the reliability of our electric system,\u201d said Chris Crane, Exelon president and CEO. \u201cHowever, these plants are long-lived assets with decades of useful life left, and today\u2019s decision is only a short-term reprieve. Policy reforms are still needed to level the playing field for all forms of clean energy and best position the state of Illinois to meet EPA\u2019s new carbon reduction rules.\u201d \n\nExelon will continue its dialogue with Illinois policymakers about market and policy reforms that properly value nuclear power for the economic and environmental benefits it provides. \n\nExelon has long supported efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector and has invested in clean technologies to improve the quality of the air for the benefit of its customers. The EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which mandates significant reductions in carbon emissions from power plants, will require the states and the power sector to find the most cost-effective solutions to achieve the required reductions. \n\nThe Illinois Environmental Protection Agency determined that the loss of two nuclear plants would increase emissions by about 24 million short tons, more than doubling the emissions reductions required under the EPA\u2019s carbon reduction rules and making it twice as costly to comply. The Illinois EPA calculated the incremental societal cost of losing two plants at more than $10 billion -- a figure that does not include the additional billions of dollars early retirements would cost in the form of higher energy bills, reduced electric reliability and lost jobs. \n\nThe auction results for the 2017-18 planning year take effect in June 2017. The transition auction was the second of two held by PJM to supplement its prior base capacity auctions for the 2016-17 and 2017-18 planning years with the new capacity performance product, which is designed to strengthen electric grid reliability. \n\nUnlike Quad Cities and Byron, Exelon\u2019s Clinton nuclear plant operates in MISO territory and did not benefit from the PJM auction results. While a MISO capacity auction held earlier this year helped reduce Clinton\u2019s economic losses, the plant remains economically challenged and is at risk of premature retirement if conditions do not improve. \n\nGrid operator PJM holds a capacity auction annually to ensure enough power generation resources are available to meet demand in its region covering all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia. Although capacity revenue in a single year is an important consideration in a plant\u2019s long-term viability, it is just one of several factors Exelon uses to make decisions about its plants\u2019 future operations. \n\nExelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) is the nation\u2019s leading competitive energy provider, with 2014 revenues of approximately $27.4 billion. Headquartered in Chicago, Exelon does business in 48 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. Exelon is one of the largest competitive U.S. power generators, with more than 32,000 megawatts of owned capacity comprising one of the nation\u2019s cleanest and lowest-cost power generation fleets. The company\u2019s Constellation business unit provides energy products and services to more than 2.5 million residential, public sector and business customers, including more than two-thirds of the Fortune 100. Exelon\u2019s utilities deliver electricity and natural gas to more than 7.8 million customers in central Maryland (BGE), northern Illinois (ComEd) and southeastern Pennsylvania (PECO).

Harding has been to the NCAA Division II playoffs twice in the past three seasons and has won 27 games in that span, easily the most successful run since moving to that level in 1997. \n \n\"It's a legitimate question,\" Huckeba said. \n \nHe has a good answer, too. \n \nHarding enters this season picked to finish second in the Great American Conference and ranked in two national preseason polls. The American Football Coaches Association ranks the Bisons No. 21, and D2football.com has them at No. 19. \n \nThose rankings acknowledge a swift ascent from five years ago, when Huckeba was beginning his fourth season with a new offense and a 13-19 overall record. Since, the Bisons have averaged more than seven victories a season and have gone 9-2 in each of the past three seasons. \n \nHuckeba said the main thing that has helped the team turn the corner is the triple-option offense that he and his staff are committed to running and a recruiting philosophy that focuses on finding a certain type of player. \n \n\"Our guys are extremely accountable,\" Huckeba said. \"We have really set the bar high for what that means. Everything from where you sit in the meeting room, your focus, the level of intensity with which you practice. Just the team work ethic. That encompasses the entire year.\" \n \nThis year, more than any other, will be a gauge for whether Huckeba's program has become established. \n \nHarding lost 10 starters from an offense that was second nationally in rushing (371.7 yards per game) and fourth in scoring (44.3 points per game) in 2014. Among the losses were two-year starting quarterback Keenan Kellett, leading rusher Romo Westbrook, who had 1,215 yards, and leading receiver Donatella Luckett, who averaged 26.2 yards per reception and scored 5 touchdowns. \n \nWhen Harding opens its season Saturday at Oklahoma Baptist, only left tackle Eric Mitchell will have started a game on offense. Only five players on defense have started a game, including senior defensive back Trendall Stevenson. He's six victories away from being a part of more victories than any other Harding player, but he will enter his senior season still trying to do what no Division II team in Arkansas has done yet -- win a playoff game. \n \nHarding has been there twice in the past three years. It lost to Northwest Missouri State 35-0 in 2012 and 59-42 at Pittsburg State last year. \n \n\"The first time, that was just an introduction,\" Stevenson said. \"This last time, it was something different about the team. We believed that we could do it. We've been two times and we've fallen short, but every guy that's on this team understands how to overcome it.\" \n \nHuckeba said he feels good about running backs Matt Tenison and Michael Latu and quarterback Park Parish, a junior from Clinton. Parish has played in 15 games with no starts, but Huckeba said he has more big-play potential than Kellett. \n \n\"He's a home-run hitter and Keenan was not,\" Huckeba said. \n \nParish said he feels comfortable in an offense with so many players who have so little experience. \n \n\"We want [opponents] to think that we're not going to be any good so we can surprise them,\" Parish said. \"That's what we want them to think.\" \n \nNot many overlook Harding anymore, and Huckeba said that has to do with its dedication to the system and method. \n \n\"We really like how we play the game,\" he said. \"We are totally sold on the triple-option offense, ball control, keep it away from your opponents and burn up the clock. Run the football, go for big plays, play great defense and be solid on special teams. \n \n\"We think that's a winning formula, and it has been for us.\" \n \nSports on 09\/02\/2","title":"Bisons grounded in offensive style","media-type":"News","source":"North West Arkansas Times","published":"2015-09-02T08:00:30Z"}

{"id":"34057240-bf12-477e-84d9-b9eb161bd581","content":"AT THE HUNGARIAN-SERBIAN BORDER (CNN) \u2013 A day after Croatia opened its border to migrants, the country changed tack Thursday, closing seven border crossings with Serbia after thousands of people streamed in. \n\nIn just two days, more than 11,000 migrants have entered Croatia from Serbia. Now \u201cuntil further notice,\u201d the Croatian Interior Ministry said on its website, traffic is banned on roads leading to the seven border crossings. \n\nThings started out smoothly, with police coaxing frightened migrants across the border Wednesday. But by Thursday, chaos erupted as thousands of people broke through police barriers set up at the train station in the border town of Tovarnik. \n\nWomen were wailing and police tried to help children as masses of people pushed their way out of the holding area set up for processing. \n\nPolice did not use force against the migrants, as they tried to keep the barriers in place. They finally gave up and the migrants started running into Croatia. \n\nTerence Pike, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Croatia, told CNN that Croatian authorities had been prepared to handle only an influx of 500 migrants and refugees a day. \n\n\u201cI think that too many refugees entered in an uncontrolled way on the first day,\u201d said Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic. \n\n\u201dYes, of course, Croatia showed a human face, but I stress that the safety of Croatian citizens and the stability of the state comes first,\u201d she said. \n\nCroatia can\u2019t care for and satisfy the needs of so many people, she said, calling for tougher surveillance across state borders. \n\nInterior Minister Ranko Ostojic said the capacity to take in migrants has been reached. \n\nBy nightfall, police set up a new perimeter in an attempt to stop more than 1,000 migrants from penetrating farther into Tovarnik, where bullet holes left over from the Balkan wars of the 1990s still scar some buildings. \n\nCroatia became the latest pressure point in the migrant crisis after Hungarian riot police used tear gas and water cannons Wednesday to turn back people at that country\u2019s border with Serbia. \n\nMigrants attempting to reach Western Europe were left with a difficult choice: Stay and contend with Hungary\u2019s tough new border defenses, or set out through Croatia on another uncertain path toward the European Union\u2019s wealthier nations. \n\nFrustrations boiled over after Hungary had sealed the final hole in its border with Serbia a day earlier, shutting off a popular route used by tens of thousands of people in Europe\u2019s vast migrant crisis. \n\nThe move left desperate men, women and children \u2014 most of them fleeing violence in the Middle East \u2014 blocked by a razor-wire fence from entering. \n\nBut the impasse at that entry point into the European Union won\u2019t stop the flow of migrants attempting their arduous journeys, said Eugenio Ambrosi, regional director of the International Organization for Migration. \n\n\u201cPeople will continue to try to reach Europe through Hungary, Croatia or any other route that might be available to them,\u201d he told CNN. \n\nAfter Croatia, migrants are expected to try to reach Germany by traveling up through Slovenia and then Austria. But it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll ultimately fare better on that route. \n\nSlovenia Prime Minister Miro Cerar tweeted Thursday that his country is committed to protecting the EU\u2019s external borders. \n\nThe Slovenian Interior Ministry said it hadn\u2019t discussed with Croatia the possibility of providing a safe corridor to migrants and that such a move would violate national and European laws. \n\nThe ministry said it would carry out its \u201cobligations to manage migration and control its borders\u201d and expected Croatia to do the same. \n\nCroatia is a member of the European Union, but unlike its northern neighbors, it isn\u2019t part of the Schengen Agreement that eliminated border controls between many EU nations. \n\nSome people gathered at the Serbian-Hungarian border said they were wary of taking the Croatian route if it meant they would only end up stuck at yet another closed crossing. \n\nThey say turning around and heading back to the troubled countries they fled \u2014 such as Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iraq \u2014 isn\u2019t an option. \n\nThe current crisis has prompted other EU nations to reintroduce security measures at borders with other member states. \n\nAustrian Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck said his country had started border control measures on its southern border with Slovenia. \n\nGermany\u2019s minister for migration and refugees resigned \u201cfor personal reasons\u201d on Thursday. \n\nManfred Schmidt had been criticized for the slow process of dealing with asylum application and creating a backlog. \n\nAt the end of August, 276,617 applications still needed to be processed, according to a ministry spokesperson. \n\n\u201cDr. Schmidt has done an excellent job and the federal interior minister regrets losing him as head of this office,\u201d German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in a statement. \n\nAid workers say Europe is facing its largest refugee and migrant crisis since World War II. \n\nMore than 430,000 migrants have come to Europe by sea so far this year, double the number that arrived during all of 2014, the International Organization for Migration said. \n\nMigrants typically cross the Mediterranean and try to go through Greece, Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary and Austria before finally reaching Germany or other European countries known to be welcoming to refugees. \n\nThe EU is still trying to figure out how to distribute 160,000 migrants \u2014 and whether to set quotas for member countries to absorb them. \n\n\u201cThe crisis is moving quite fast \u2014 and unfortunately is moving much faster than the response that was put in place by all the concerned governments,\u201d said Ambrosi of the IOM.","title":"Migrant crisis: Croatia closes border crossings as thousands stream in","media-type":"News","source":"1490Wosh.com","published":"2015-09-18T01:13:08Z"}
{"id":"088303a8-e16c-4568-a710-fb95692876f4","content":"Seoul: At the height of the Korean Peninsula tensions last month, South Korean loudspeakers blared propaganda messages across the DMZ to hundreds of thousands of troops stationed over the border in the North. \n\nDesigned to chip away at morale, the taunts infuriated the North Korean leadership. President Park has met with President Xi in China three times! the speakers boomed. How many times has Kim Jong-un met with President Xi? \n\nThe answer: none. \n\n\"If the North Korean people knew that they would probably be quite shocked,\" said veteran China watcher, journalist and commentator Jong-dae Ha, from South Korea's highest circulating newspaper, Dong-A Ilbo. \"I don't think Kim Jong-un was too happy watching that parade.\" \n\n\"That parade\" was China's commemorative World War II military spectacular, held in Beijing on September 3. South Korean President Park Geun-hye raised eyebrows as she stood, resplendent in yellow, just a Russian president away from China's Xi Jinping, watching Beijing's conspicuous display of manpower and hardware. \n\nPark was the only leader of a US ally to attend. That the occasion gave the Chinese an excuse to bring out the good silverware (like the new DF-21D anti-ship \"carrier killer\" missile) so troubled Western leaders, they stayed away in droves. (Australia sent Veterans Affairs minister Michael Ronaldson, also known in China as \"Who?\".) \n\nNorth Korea's Kim Jong-un was not at the parade. His envoy didn't even get the front row, let alone a seat near Putin. \n\nPark's attendance was highly controversial in South Korea, and a curious look for a major US ally. \"[It's] a big puzzle to many even among her supporters,\" says Hyung-A Kim, Associate Professor of Korean politics at the Australian National University. \n\nIn Seoul, everyone has a theory. This is north-east Asia, where an infernal tangle of alliances, frozen hostilities, superpower tensions and historical grievances sits alongside ever-deepening trade flows and shifting power plays. Nothing is simple, and symbolism is important. \n\nSouth Korean media chalked it as a victory for Park, not a scoop for Beijing or a rebuff to the US. She was there to press Beijing for its support for Korean unification at a time when Beijing's patience with Pyongyang has run thin. \n\nThat may be so, says Cho Min, from the Korean Institute for National Unification in Seoul. China's longstanding position has been that it doesn't want conflict on the peninsula, and it doesn't want Kim's regime to collapse. Therefore, \"the only help China can give, from our perspective, is by not intervening at all, so we should take every opportunity to explain that to them\". \n\nIt is not clear whether Kim wasn't invited to the parade or refused to go after demands for special treatment were turned down. \n\nBut the China-North Korea relationship has been strained at least since Kim executed his uncle, the former chief China envoy Chang Song-taek, in December 2013. Ha said the problems go back further, to the sudden ascent of the 28-year-old Kim to North Korea's leadership in 2011. \n\n\"From Xi's point of view, Kim Jong-un is just a young man. Park is the same age as Xi and they have shared experiences. So he's probably not the right partner to sit down and have a heart-to-heart with Kim Jong-un,\" said the journalist Ha. \n\nPark has held six summit meetings with Xi, three of them in China, since she was elected in 2013. During the flare-up of Korean Peninsula tensions in August, the Chinese exerted pressure on the North Koreans to stand down, moving Chinese troops to the North Korean border and letting that be known in the Chinese press. \n\n\"Chinese cooperation was provided to a certain extent, and that is why President Park attended the parade,\" said Ha. \n\nFurther, the South Koreans were pleased that the Chinese chose the occasion of Park's visit to declare a push to resume the six-party talks, a sort of world's-grimmest dinner party where China, the US, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas sit down to try for progress on the denuclearisation of North Korea. The talks have been stalled since 2009 and China, which is the source of most of Pyongyang's food and energy, is considered to have the most sway over the North. \n\nBut Hyung-A Kim points out that China has not changed its basic stance on North Korea; and that US alliance politics looms over this too. \n\n\"Despite China's visibly warm welcome to Park, there was no epoch-making agreement between Park and Xi, just as there was no fundamental change in China's North Korea policy,\" she said. \"She attended the military parade mainly to show the change in her government's diplomatic approach, especially to expand [South] Korea's own diplomatic space by resisting US pressure to turn down the Chinese invitation.\" \n\nPark's attendance may have been \"a hot issue across the world\", said Ha, but there were also many reasons why it was reasonable she was there. The two neighbours have a long history of relations, a quarter of Korea's exports go to China, and China pressed hard for her presence.

She was a visitor to Glasgow, studying to expand her knowledge in furtherance of her career in nursing. She was a much loved member of a close and united family. \n\n\"To you she was a stranger who appeared tragically to have accepted a lift in your car. Within a matter of minutes, for some inexplicable reason, you destroyed her young life and devastated a family.\" \n\n\n\nThe judge said Pacteau had gone to \u201cextraordinary lengths\u201d to conceal what he had done and told a \u201ctissue of lies\u201d and a \"concoted story\" to police investigating her disappearance. \n\nIn delivering her sentence she said: \"You now, through your counsel, claim to be remorseful. Remorse was, however, only expressed for the first time when you pleaded guilty. \n\n\"From a perusal of the criminal justice social work report, it is apparent that in the course of your lengthy interviews with the social worker, at no time did you ever demonstrate or express any regret for what you had done. \n\n\"That expression of remorse on 11 August might have carried more weight if communicated earlier. And it is difficult, in my view, to envisage someone who is truly sorry for killing another human being, going to the lengths to which you went to cover up your appalling crime, whilst making up false stories about the deceased.\" \n\nMiss Buckley\u2019s parents John and Marian travelled from Cork to see Pacteau plead guilty on August 11 and were in court again today. \n\nPrevious conviction \n\nThe qualified nurse had only been in Glasgow for a few months before her killing. \n\nShe had recently left her job at an Essex hospital and moved to Scotland to study for a masters degree in occupational health therapy at Glasgow Caledonian University. \n\nMiss Buckley was described as an outgoing woman whose life revolved around her family and friends. \n\nPacteau, who described himself as a \u201cself-employed sales consultant\u201d, has a previous conviction for printing counterfeit money. \n\nIt emerged after his conviction that he stood trial in 2013 at the High Court in Paisley accused of attempting to rape a woman in a Glasgow lane. He was found not guilty of the charge. \n\nIn the early hours of April 12, he met Miss Buckley outside the Sanctuary nightclub and drove her to nearby Kelvin Way, where he grabbed her neck and delivered about a dozen blows with a spanner. \n\nThe killer visited various shops to purchase caustic soda before placing her body in the bath at his flat. \n\nOn trips to High Craigton Farm on the outskirts of the city, he burned a mattress and clothes before buying a barrel, placing Miss Buckley\u2019s body inside and locking it in a storage unit he had rented. \n\nPacteau initially claimed to detectives, who identified him from CCTV footage, that they went back to his flat and she had fallen and injured herself on the bed frame. \n\nHis solicitor John Scullion QC said he could offer no \u201drational explanation\u201d for his actions.","title":"Judge: Karen Buckley's murder was a 'brutal, motiveless attack on a defenceless young woman'","media-type":"News","source":"Irish Examiner","published":"2015-09-08T09:54:05Z"}

{"id":"511e636f-e06d-4f1f-b5eb-fbacafe5b9c4","content":"Kim Davis, the Rowan County clerk who has been in the national spotlight for refusing to hand out marriage licenses, will appear before a federal judge this morning for a hearing on whether she should be held in contempt. \n\nThe plaintiffs in the case have asked the federal judge to fine Davis until she starts issuing marriage licenses again. \n\nAs we've reported , a lower court had ordered Davis to issue marriage licenses, despite her religious objections. She appealed and then went all the way up to the Supreme Court to ask that the lower court's decision be put aside while she waited for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit to issue an opinion on the matter. \n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court denied that stay , tacitly ordering Davis to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Davis has refused. \n\nIn a motion filed with the court yesterday , her lawyers argued that it is presently \"impossible\" for Davis to comply with the court order because it would \"irreparably and irreversibly violates her conscience by directing her to authorize and issue SSM licenses bearing her name and approval.\" \n\nLegal scholars disagree with that assessment. \n\nHere's how Katherine Franke, a law professor at Columbia University where she heads the Public Rights\/Private Conscience Project , explained it to NPR's Robert Siegel earlier this week : \n\n \nFRANKE: She has absolutely no legal ground to stand on. As a public official, she's supposed to abide by the law and perform her public duties, which are issuing marriage licenses to qualified couples. Same-sex couples are now qualified to marry in the state of Kentucky, so she is refusing to do her job. \n\nSIEGEL: But are there protections - even for public officials - for some religious convictions that might, in some ways, conflict with someone else's performance of the same job? \n\nFRANKE: Of course. Kim Davis has all sorts of religious liberty rights secured under the First Amendment and under other laws. But they are not at stake in this case. All she's asked to do with couples that come before her is certify that they've met the state requirements for marriage. So her religious opposition to same-sex marriage is absolutely irrelevant in this context. \n\n \nIt's worth noting that in an amicus brief filed yesterday , Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers asked the court to \"temper its response.\" \n\nThe laws of the state, argues Stivers, have not yet caught up with the Supreme Court decision that made same-sex marriage legal across the whole United States. \n\nIn fact, Stivers argues, state law currently contains penalties for performing prohibited marriages \u2014 such as those between people who are \"nearer of kin ... than second cousins\" \u2014 but does not contain penalties for refusing to issue licenses to those who are permitted to marry. \n\nSo, Stivers argues, the court should slow down and let the legislature sort this out before holding Davis in contempt.","title":"Kentucky Clerk Faces Contempt Hearing In Federal Court","media-type":"News","source":"WWNO","published":"2015-09-03T13:08:00Z"}
{"id":"e161bd2b-7f90-428b-8b83-af566f081000","content":", EDT. NEW YORK, N.Y. - The cast of the hit series \"Empire\" were tight-lipped about the drama that unfolds on the upcoming second season, but when it came to discussing secrets about the show before it had its launch earlier this year \u2014 they were revealing. \n\nEmmy nominee Taraji P. Henson, Terrence Howard, creator Lee Daniels and more from the top-rated Fox show premiered the season two opener at Carnegie Hall in New York City on Saturday in front of a feverish audience. \n\nHoward entered the prestigious venue, where few from the hip-hop world have performed, with his fist up in the air and yelled \"Empire!\" as the audience applauded. The cast sat tightly on the second level at the hall and even took a selfie, directed by Henson. \n\nBut after the juicy episode aired, the show's producers and cast, including Jussie Smollett and Gabourey Sidibe, sat down for a Q&A that was hilarious and intense, but overall, in the show's fashion, dramatic \u2014 curse words and all. \n\n____ \n\nHENSON: 'EMPIRE' IS MOVING THE NEEDLE \n\nHenson, Daniels and the cast spoke at length about how they were surprised that a series like \"Empire\" had found success on prime-time television, or as Henson put it, \"free TV.\" The first season of the show, starring Howard as drug dealer-turned rapper-turned record label owner Lucious Lyon, has seen ratings grow each episode and its finale drew 17 million viewers. \n\n\"I honestly thought, 'This would be great. We will put this incredible work in the can and Fox would choke and put it on cable,\" said Henson, who earned an Emmy nomination for playing Cookie Lyon. \"And I get the call that the show is picked up. I was like, 'What! Are they crazy?'\" \n\n\"You want to do the work that's going to challenge people to think and ruffle feathers and get people upset and spark intelligent conversations so that change can happen,\" she continued. \n\nHenson also said \"Empire\" is more than just a TV series and called her and Howard's characters, former drug dealers, \"heroes in a very American way.\" \n\n\"'Cause you can judge (Cookie), you can say whatever you want about her, about Lucious, about what they did to get where they are, but at the end of the day, their sons are not statistics. OK. Their sons are not in jail ... they broke a cycle of poverty and anybody that's from the hood knows that that is very hard to do,\" she said and earned applause. \"It's very hard to do. To break (the cycle) and I don't mean break it for yourselves, but it for your sons, for the black boys that are coming up.\" \n\nDaniels, who produced \"Monster's Ball\" and directed \"The Butler,\" also got political after thanking the chairman-CEOs of Fox Television Group, Dana Walden and Gary Newman, for their support with \"Empire.\" \n\n\"I want to say to them, 'Thank you for letting me do tonight because tonight is so important for me.' Where we are right now in America with race relations is an ugly place and it's time we tear the roof off this mother (trucker),\" he said. \n\n____ \n\nSMOLLETT AUDITIONED FOR ROLE SINGING 'BLURRED LINES' \n\nSmollett, who plays an openly gay singer and succeeded his father to run Empire Entertainment, said he auditioned for the role of Jamal by singing Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" a cappella. \n\n\"I love Robin Thicke! Robin Thicke is talented, I have his albums, but this one sang it a capella,\" Henson said. \n\nSmollett went on to sing it live without background beats or a band at Carnegie Hall. \n\n\"I sent Lee a message, I said, 'He is the baddest b---- in the room,'\" Howard said of Smollett. \n\n____ \n\nLET'S DANCE \n\nThe singing for Smollett didn't end there. \n\nFollowing the Q&A, he and his TV brother, Bryshere \"Yazz\" Gray, went on to perform popular songs from the series, including \"Drip Drop\" and \"You're So Beautiful.\" \n\nDuring the latter, Sidibe \u2014 whose screen credits include \"Precious\" and \"American Horror Story\" \u2014 joined the duo onstage. She whipped her hair back and forth, twirled and twerked. \n\n____ \n\nGABBY GETS SERIOUS \n\nSidibe, who plays an assistant named Becky on the series, said the script originally called for a \"boyish, petite white woman.\" \n\n\"And Lee said, 'If you like the script, you can just ignore that and we'll figure it out,'\" said Sidibe, who worked with Daniels on \"Precious.\" \n\nAnd then she got deep. \n\n\"You guys don't understand, Lee is the first person in the entire world that has looked at me, looked my skin colour, looked at my body, looked at my talent and said, 'Perfect.'\" \n\n____ \n\nTARAJI WANTED LEAD ROLE IN 'PRECIOUS' \n\nSpeaking of \"Precious,\" Henson said she auditioned for the role of Clareece \"Precious\" Jones, an overweight, illiterate and abused teen. \n\n\"I'm a little nuts,\" said Henson, who explained that Daniels wanted her to audition for the role of Precious' teacher, played by Paula Patton. \n\n\"And I was like, 'That ain't the role, the role is Precious!'\" Henson said. \n\n___ \n\nI'M A RAPPER, NOT AN ACTOR \n\nTa'Rhonda Jones, who plays the role of Henson's assistant Porsha, said when she auditioned for the show, she thought it was a rap gig. \n\n\"I walked in the door pretty blinded. I originally thought I was going to be a rapper for Terrence Howard because that's what my brother called me and told me,\" said Jones, a rapper who had never acted. \"Terrence Howard was looking for female rappers in their 20's and I thought he was trying to come out with a 'Hustle & Flow' (record) label.\" \n\nThe audience burst into laughter. \n\nJones also admitted she didn't even know who Daniels was. \n\n\"I thought he was some crazy man,\" she said. \n\n____ \n\nThe second season of \"Empire\" premieres Sept. 23 on Fox. \n \nContent Provided By Canadian Press.","title":"Cast of hit Fox series 'Empire' reveal pre-show secrets at NYC premiere for season 2","media-type":"News","source":"CJAD 800","published":"2015-09-13T04:56:04Z"}
{"id":"29ba0b32-cc9b-4db5-9584-d1e32f24d6fc","content":"TAUNTON - A cloud of uncertainty hanging over the Massachusetts casino market has cleared. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe announced last Friday that the federal Department of the Interior has approved its request for an initial reservation, including a 152-acre site in Taunton, where the tribe plans to build a casino. The decision comes as the state\u2019s Gaming Commission weighs whether to license a commercial casino in Southeastern Massachusetts. Mass Gaming & Entertainment\u2019s proposal for a casino in Brockton \u2014 17 miles north of Taunton \u2014 is the only commercial proposal still in contention for this region. \u201cThis is a timely decision, as the Massachusetts Gaming Commission wrestles with whether to issue a commercial casino license in that region,\u201d state Senate President Stan Rosenberg said in a statement. \u201cI believe the MGC has the responsibility to weigh the significant market over saturation that would no doubt occur with multiple resort casinos in the southeastern region.\u201d The Mashpee are pursuing a casino through the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which is outside of the state\u2019s commercial licensure process. Under the federal law, a tribal casino must be built on sovereign tribal land. A compact between the state and the tribe stipulates that a tribal casino in Taunton would pay the state 17 percent of its gambling revenue in lieu of taxes, provided there are no commercial casinos in Southeastern Massachusetts, an area defined as Bristol County, Plymouth County and the Cape and Islands. If another casino were built in the region, however, the tribe would pay no casino revenue to the state. Commercial casinos, meanwhile, are taxed at 25 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge advantage,\u201d  Clyde Barrow, manager of the Northeastern Gaming Research Project, said. Barrow is also chairman of the political science department at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine a $400 million-per-year casino taxed at 25 percent. That\u2019s a $100 million advantage on marketing the casino, comping rooms, building customer loyalty and maintaining amenities.\u201d Mass Gaming & Entertainment has long maintained that a casino in Brockton would be successful with or without a competing tribal casino in Taunton, although it would be more successful without the competition. \u201cWe believe, based on experience and significant market research, that a casino in Brockton would be successful even with a tribal casino in Taunton,\u201d Joe Baerlein, a spokesman for Mass Gaming & Entertainment, said. \u201cWe would not be applying for the Region C license and committing our own significant funds if we were not confident in this project.\u201d The state Gaming Commission has previously stated it is on track to vote in early 2016 on a commercial license in Southeastern Massachusetts, which the panel has designated \u201cRegion C.\u201d Page 2 of 2 - A discussion on Region C was on the agenda for the commission\u2019s Sept. 24 meeting. \u201cThe decision by the U.S. Department of Interior to approve land into trust is a milestone for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe,\u201d Gaming Commission spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll said. \u201cThis determination provides further important information for the decisions the commission must make in the weeks ahead.\u201d State law allows for up to three commercial casinos and one slots parlor statewide. Gaming regulators have stressed that they are not obligated to award a commercial license in Region C and will evaluate the status of the tribe and a variety of economic factors before making a final decision. \u201cThe commission looks forward to continuing the discussion about the path forward as it relates to gaming in Southeastern Massachusetts and remains committed to making decisions that are based on the long-term best interest of the commonwealth,\u201d Driscoll said. Barrow said that if a tribal casino in Taunton is certain, he wouldn\u2019t license a Brockton casino. The proponents of a New Bedford casino cited the prospect of a Mashpee Wampanoag casino in Taunton when they announced in July that they were dropping out of the running for the Region C license. \u201cThe reluctance of lenders to provide the requisite financing is due to several factors, including the possibility of competition from a nearby Indian casino, which would pay no taxes or other compensation to the commonwealth,\u201d KG Urban Inc. principal Barry Gosin wrote in a July 22 letter informing the Gaming Commission of his firm\u2019s decision to abandon its proposed New Bedford casino. Baerlein, however, predicted Mass Gaming & Entertainment would find success in Brockton. \u201cWhile it is likely that the Department of Interior\u2019s decision will be challenged and litigated for years, our proposal will bring needed revenues, jobs and economic development to Brockton and the commonwealth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe the Gaming Commission should continue with the Region C licensing process.\u201d Gerry Tuoti can be reached at gtuoti@wickedlocal.com or 508-967-3137.","title":"MASHPEE WAMPANOAG TRIBE: Federal announcement shakes up casino market","media-type":"News","source":"Wicked Local Halifax","published":"2015-09-25T23:00:00Z"}

Whereas 2009 saw house prices falling in the wake of the recession, we are now seeing house prices reach new peaks, as healthy demand for homes fuels property price growth.\n\n\u201cSimultaneously, equity release lifetime mortgage rates have fallen sharply, meaning the plans on offer are appealing to more homeowners seeking a bit of extra income or a lump cash sum than ever before.\n\n\u201cThe number of providers offering equity release plans has also widened, and with trusted household names like Legal & General launching earlier this year, customers are enjoying some of the most competitive deals we\u2019ve ever had.\n\nMature customers benefit from lower rates\n\nThe data also shows that rates have reduced amongst all ages of equity release customers, with mature customers particularly benefitting.\n\nAge Partnership\u2019s average 65 year old customer currently has a rate of 5.95 per cent, compared to a customer 10 years older who benefits from a lower rate of 5.74 per cent. However, both ages have seen a drop in rates to record lows since 2009 when rates were over 6.60 per cent (see graph 2).\n\nGraph 2: Average rates for 65 year old and 75 year old customers since 2009 \n\nSource: Age Partnership\u2019s management information\n\nRising property prices are helping to balance out the interest paid\n\nHouse price growth is helping to counteract the interest owed for taking out an equity release plan, meaning equity release customers can hang onto more of the equity in their house for longer.\n\nLooking at the typical Age Partnership customer this year to date, they have on average released \u00a343,972 at an average fixed rate of 5.82 per cent on a property worth \u00a3252,951. By releasing less than 20 per cent of the value of their home, compared to an average maximum available of 34 per cent, they are evidently being sensible, taking just enough to meet whatever their needs may be.\n\nAs the research table below shows, a realistic 2 per cent house price growth assumption each year will ensure they have over 80 per cent of the remaining equity left to leave to loved ones when they die.\n\nIf house prices were to rise at 2 per cent a year \u2013 much lower than the current annual growth of 5.7 per cent \u2013 the average property value would have risen to \u00a3320,803 by 2027.\n\nOver the same time, the size of the equity owed would have risen to \u00a386,694. However, this would leave total remaining equity of \u00a3234,109, up from \u00a3208,979 initially, showing the equity owned in the house would not be eroded in monetary terms.

Through the company's global YouthSpark initiative, scores of nonprofit organizations around the world will receive cash donations and other resources to provide computer science education to diverse populations of young people in their communities and prepare them with the computational-thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for success in an increasingly digital world. \n\n\"If we are going to solve tomorrow's global challenges, we must come together today to inspire young people everywhere with the promise of technology,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. \"We can't leave anyone out. We're proud to make this $70 million investment in computer science education to create new opportunities for students across the spectrum of diverse youth and help build a tech talent pipeline that will spark new innovations for the future.\" \n\nOver the next three years, Microsoft will deliver on this commitment through cash grants and nonprofit partnerships as well as unique program and content offerings to increase access to computer science education and build computational thinking skills for diverse populations of youth. One of the flagship programs is Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS), which pairs tech professionals from across the industry with classroom educators to team-teach computer science in U.S. high schools. TEALS aims to grow fivefold in the next three years, with the goal of working with 2,000 tech industry volunteers to reach 30,000 students in nearly 700 schools across 33 states. A key objective of TEALS is to support classroom educators as they learn the computer science coursework, preparing them to teach computer science independently after two years of team-teaching. \n\nNadella reinforced the company's commitment to computer science education today during the annual Dreamforce conference hosted by Salesforce where he called upon thousands of tech professionals to serve as TEALS volunteers and help broaden the opportunity for students of all backgrounds to learn computer science in high school. \n\n\"Computer science is a foundational subject \u2014 like algebra, chemistry or physics \u2014 for learning how the world works, yet it's offered in less than 25 percent of American high schools,\" said Microsoft President Brad Smith. \"We need to increase access to computer science and computational thinking for all students, especially those from diverse populations, by partnering across the industry and with teachers and schools to turn this situation around and change the paradigm for developing a more diverse tech talent pipeline.\" \n\nThere are three additional key elements of Microsoft's global commitment to increasing access for all youth to the full range of computing skills, from digital literacy to computer science. \n\nGlobal philanthropic investments with nonprofits in 80 countries, including the Center for Digital Inclusion in Latin America, Silatech in the Middle East and Africa, CoderDojo Foundation in Europe, YCAB Foundation in Asia, and many others, will deliver a range of computing skills from digital literacy to computer science education to youth in local communities around the world. \n\nMicrosoft Imagine connects students with the tools, resources and experiences they need to turn their innovative ideas into reality. Whether it's building a game or designing an app, Microsoft Imagine makes learning to code easy and accessible for students and educators, no matter their age or skill level and at no cost. Whether it's free cloud services like Azure, online competitions via Imagine Cup that educators can incorporate into their curriculum, or fun self-serve learning tutorials, Microsoft Imagine helps bring a student's technology passion to life through computer science. \n\nYouthSpark Hub resources are designed to inspire youth about the full spectrum of computing skills, ranging from digital literacy to computer science engineering. In addition to providing access to the Microsoft Imagine tools, the YouthSpark Hub brings together opportunities to participate in activities such as DigiGirlz and YouthSpark Live, attend free YouthSpark Camps at the Microsoft Stores, and access training through nonprofit organizations supported by Microsoft around the world. \n\nSince 2012, Microsoft YouthSpark has created new opportunities for more than 300 million youth around the world, offering technology skills training and connections to employment, entrepreneurship, and continued education or training. \n\nMore information about YouthSpark and access to tools and resources can be found at http:\/\/YouthSparkHub.com and http:\/\/imagine.microsoft.com. \n\nThose wanting more information on the TEALS program and to learn more about how they can get involved should visit http:\/\/TEALSK12.org. \n\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. \n\nLogo - http:\/\/photos.prnewswire.com\/prnh\/20000822\/MSFTLOGO \n\n\u00a0 \n\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/microsoft-expands-global-youthspark-initiative-to-focus-on-computer-science-300144592.html \n\nSOURCE Microsoft Corp.","title":"Microsoft expands global YouthSpark initiative to focus on computer science","media-type":"News","source":"Fat Pitch Financials","published":"2015-09-17T01:00:00Z"}

{"id":"6177ebc1-8420-4b11-b7e6-f2c6c1dde6e1","content":"(CNN) \u2013 For the past decade, we\u2019ve drilled into children that when they ride a bike, they need to wear a helmet. Now scientists say it may be too late: Tricycle riders should be wearing them, too. \n\nThink this is a case of safety overkill? Authors of a new study published in the journal Pediatrics say the answer is in the numbers. \n\nAccording to their estimates, there were 9,340 cases of tricycle-related accidents that sent children to emergency rooms in 2012 and 2013. The most common body part injured: a child\u2019s head \u2014 and head injuries can cause lasting damage. \n\nCo-author Sean Bandzar, a medical student at the Medical College of Georgia, said he noticed a few of his small patients coming in with lacerations to the face after riding trikes. He wanted to know more about the injuries and did a medical literature search, but most of the research was limited or outdated, he said. \n\nUsing data collected from 100 emergency rooms for the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, researchers found that boys are more likely than girls to turn up in the emergency room. Two-year-olds seem to have the most accidents, although there were tricycle injuries for children up to age 7. The most common broken bone was the elbow and the most common injury overall was a cut to the face. \n\nIn addition to helmets, the authors suggest kids wear elbow pads, and that parents supervise their children while they ride. \n\n\u201cWe really feel strongly that the child should be able to ride in an environment free of hazards,\u201d Bandzar said. \u201cHave them ride away from the street and away from water.\u201d \n\nThe good news is the majority of children sent to the ER after trike accidents are treated and released. Only 224 of the more than 9,000 injured were admitted to the hospital. Deaths have increased, but not at a statistically significant rate, according to an earlier study. \n\nKnowing the types of injuries tykes on trikes may experience should help doctors make safety equipment recommendations. \n\nAs an emergency room doctor in Ohio, Dr. Gary Smith has seen his share of tricycle accident patients over the years. He thinks the study is a good start, although he cautions about drawing significant conclusions from two years of data, which he considers narrow. Smith, the president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance, has worked with similar data and said he\u2019d love to see expanded research. \n\nSmith said he doesn\u2019t recommend elbow pads, but helmets are a must for his own children any time they take a ride. When parents ask for advice, he tells them it\u2019s their choice, but he has three suggestions: \u201cWear a helmet, wear a helmet, wear a helmet,\u201d Smith said. \n\nHis organization has done crash tests with tricycles. Injuries from falls can be significant. \u201cConcrete is unforgiving and it doesn\u2019t take a fall from very high to cause a serious transfer of energy. We\u2019ve even seen a child die after a fall on concrete from only 4 feet up,\u201d he said. \u201cThese injuries are not always this serious. I\u2019ve also seen children come in with bruises, bumps and slight concussions, but I don\u2019t want to take that chance with my own child.\u201d \n\nThe authors of the study in Pediatrics suggest manufacturers consider a couple of design changes to help make tricycles safer. An earlier study found that most accidents happen when a child turns the handlebars too fast and tips over or falls. Most children don\u2019t have the depth perception or coordination yet to catch themselves or to fall without injury. Limiting the turning radius of a trike may prevent these accidents. A device that limits the maximum speed may also help, especially for children living on or riding near hills. Most tricycles don\u2019t have brakes. \n\nOverall, Smith and the authors think riding tricycles is a good experience for children.

But how much is too much?\n\nAustralia's National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines are reassuringly vague: \"Enjoy in moderation.\" In the US, the Mayo Clinic hedges: up to 400 milligrams of caffeine a day \"appears to be safe for most healthy adults\". That's about four filter cups a day, or as many as six espressos on American caffeine content figures \u2013 fewer with the higher-dose espresso shots common in Australia.\n\nThe real question is not \"How much?\" but \"How many is reasonable?\"\n\nIn Finland the mid-morning coffee break is legislated into working conditions: as usual, Scandinavia leads in progressive social policy.

Shares rose as much as 15% on Monday before\u00a0leveling at $20.72, \u00a0a gain of 5.2%. \n \nPandora shares have been on a roller coaster ride for much of the past year amid speculation that the\u00a0U.S. Copyright Royalty Board would rule in favor of music publishers and songwriters over the streaming service, and that Apple 's Music app would ultimately inexorably weaken the company.  \n \nNeither has yet occurred. \n \nIn an e-mailed statement, Netflix  said that the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board\u00a0would support\u00a0Pandora's request to use the so-called\u00a0Merlin\/Naxos agreements as benchmarks in its final rate decision. The decision bolsters Pandora's business model of which royalty fees comprise about 50%. To pay higher fees, Pandora had argued, would jeopardize the company's ability to remain solvent. \n \n\"We are pleased that the Copyright Office affirmed the admissibility of Pandora's agreement with Merlin as a valid benchmark in the Copyright Royalty Board proceedings,\" the statement said.\u00a0\"We look forward to the certainty that December's decision will bring, and are prepared to thrive in a number of potential outcomes. Our investments in the business are providing real return, including almost $1.5 billion in royalties to date.\" \n \nA final decision is expected from the board on Dec. 16. Sound Exchange, an association that represents musicians on royalty issues, and had opposed Pandora in presentations before the royalty board, couldn't immediately be reached for comment. \n \nThe royalty board's favorable preliminary decision comes as Pandora shares have actually gained 7.1% since Apple made public the details of its new Music app. Predictions of Pandora's decline as a result of Apple Music have thus far not materialized. That's due to a number of factors, the first being that Pandora's ad-supported service already had 79.2 million users at the end of March 31, a hefty customer base providing an ample head start. \n \nSecondly, Pandora's curated radio model appeals to\u00a0listeners who may not want to be constantly selecting songs. The dueling apps are a battle between a lean-back vs. a lean-in style of music listening. \n \nAnd thirdly, Pandora has shown that the great bulk of its users are content to listen to ads rather than pay for subscriptions to avoid them.

Yet again raising the bar for bot driven ad fraud research, White Ops analyzed 30 Billion impressions across 32 companies in the DCN membership. \n\nMost notably, the Report found only three percent of DCN advertising impressions came from bots, which are bots not listed in the industry bots and spiders list and known browser list. This percentage is one quarter and one tenth of the bot levels found in display and video inventory respectively as part of the 2014 ANA Bot Baseline research, which was also conducted by White Ops. The Report also found that employing viewability tags as a metric for quality is an inexact tool and an effective cover for bots. \n   \nDCN represents the most trusted and well-respected media brands that, together, have an unduplicated audience of 230,604 million unique visitors or 100 percent reach of the U.S. online population.* In the 2015 DCN and White Ops report, 32 DCN member organizations participated and their data was collected over 53 days between June and August 2015. The sample consisted of more than 30 billion total impressions, including more than 16 billion measurable, non-mobile impressions. \n  \n\"Advertising fraud is an industry-wide problem that needs to be addressed by all participants,\" said DCN CEO Jason Kint. \"This 2015 report should be seen as a tool that allows the industry to study the habits and successful performance of highly trusted premium publishers. We want to see an ecosystem in which every site can rise to the cleanliness standard of the DCN publishers detailed in this report. At the same time, our members must continue to be diligent as fraud is an evolving problem and trust is earned each and every day.\" \n\nIn contrast to the 2014 ANA Bot Baseline, the 2015 DCN report focused on bot levels in premium direct and programmatic inventory from nationally recognized, high volume publishers with a focus predominantly on display inventory. The 2014 ANA Bot Baseline comprised a broader set of media types, quality levels, site and campaign volumes and other parameters. Some of the most important discoveries in the new data include: \nSmarter than the average bot : Viewability measurement does not reveal human audience rates. Bots are extremely good at spoofing viewability in nearly three quarters of cases studied and bots that come from a host dedicated to fraud have high viewable rates and most frequently post back detailed viewability data. Equal opportunity fraud: In contrast to the nearly 70 percent of bots coming from residential sources in the earlier study, residential traffic was below 50 percent and the remainder was spread more evenly across other categories, including hosted, enterprise and carrier environments, as well as from mobile platforms. Having policy is the best policy: Bot rates appeared to be higher among publishers who sell data to third party data management platforms or were more likely to syndicate content and sell inventory through advertising networks. Searching for trouble: Small traffic recommenders and some search companies had high bot rates -- particularly when coming from certain top-level domains. \n\"Measure twice, cut once doesn't work if you can trick the ruler,\" said Michael Tiffany, co-founder and CEO of White Ops. \"The most lucrative websites draw the most talented criminals and bot operators have become very talented. Bots have become so sophisticated at mimicking consumer behavior that we can't trust metrics like viewability. There is no silver bullet for eradicating bot fraud. It takes vigilance, focus and a collective industry commitment to getting better -- or raising the barriers and cost for those who won't.\" \n\nCut...Then Measure \n\nWhile the average measured bot level was three percent, there were some premium publishers well below that rate -- in some cases, less than two percent. The policies and standards set by the DCN sample are a good starting point as to where the broader population of publishers can look to reduce bot traffic levels, thereby increasing inventory quality, including: \nStrictly vet third party traffic : Three of the top five publishers with the lowest sophisticated bot percentages sourced traffic from Taboola and\/or Outbrain. Do not use viewability as a sole measure of humanity: Publishers with bot rates below the DCN average did not bill based solely on viewability. Maintain visibility and control over inventory : Inventory that was tagged for media type had bot percentages that were well below the average bot percentage of the DCN group. Limit the use of retargeting: The top volume publishers, who did not retarget site visitors, had an average sophisticated bot percentage of 1.79 percent, compared to the higher sophisticated bot average of 2.68 percent for similar publishers who retarget site visitors. \n*Source: comScore, Inc.\u00ae, January 2015 \n\nFollow White Ops: \nWhite Ops on Twitter  \nWhite Ops on LinkedIn  \nWhite Ops on YouTube \n\nAbout Digital Content Next \nDigital Content Next (DCN) is the only trade organization dedicated to serving the unique and diverse needs of high-quality digital content companies that manage trusted, direct relationships with consumers and marketers.

But their efforts were unsuccessful. \n\nThe Zorbaughs died of smoke inhalation and burns, the coroner's office announced on Monday. \n\nMichaels said Anthony Zorbaugh had \"significant health issues\" and had trouble moving around. It appeared that Connie Zorbuagh had been trying to help him get out, the chief said. \n\nThe house is not a total loss, but damage is estimated at $45,000, the chief said. \n\n\u2014 Reach Greg Gross at ggross@yorkdispatch.com . \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n\u00a92015 The York Dispatch (York, Pa.) \n\nVisit The York Dispatch (York, Pa.) at www.yorkdispatch.com \n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \n\n_____ \n\nTopics: t000037113,t000040408,t0001981","title":"Fatal York City fire ruled accidental","media-type":"News","source":"Lancaster Online","published":"2015-09-15T00:08:00Z"}
{"id":"2987e140-c3c6-47d6-843a-23290bd3ec81","content":"The telephones fell silent and the radio chatter stopped after the second plane hit the World Trade Center. \n \n\"On live TV we saw the plane flying in and make impact,\" said Dayman Perry, commander of operations at Niagara Emergency Medical Services, recalling Sept. 11, 2001. \n \n\"There was utter disbelief at what we were seeing.\" \n \nPerry, a new hire at the Hamilton Central Ambulance communications centre, was undergoing training to become an ambulance dispatcher on that fateful morning. \n \n\"After the second strike, there was hardly any radio traffic, no one was talking and the phone was hardly ringing. It was eerily quiet.\" \n \nThat morning, hijackers affiliated with al-Qaida carried out a series of co-ordinated suicide attacks on U.S. soil that claimed almost 3,000 lives. \n \nOn that same morning, Lyle Renaud was getting ready for work at a private company doing medical care and first aid. \n \nHe was only months away from being hired by Niagara EMS. \n \n\"I was getting my uniform on and watching TV and noticed the second plane come in from the corner and strike the right tower,\" he said. \n \nRenaud was engrossed by the live news coverage of the events. \n \n\"What sticks with me most was the first responders rushing in - the firefighters, the police, the paramedics,\" he said. \n \n\"They weren't thinking is this a terrorist attack? They were thinking how many lives can we save.\" \n \nOn the first anniversary of the attacks, Renaud participated in a memorial parade in downtown St. Catharines. \n \n\"It was very emotional and difficult to take in.\" \n \nThe emotions, he said, were palpable. \n \n\"A lot of people were getting out of their cars and crying. Many were mouthing the words 'thank you.'\" \n \nFourteen years later, Renaud is now an advanced care paramedic with Niagara EMS. The timeline of Sept. 11 remains fresh in his memory. \n \n\"I can remember everything I was doing that day,\" he said. \n \nThe events of that day remain vivid for Niagara EMS chief Kevin Smith as well. \n \nSmith was working as the agency's manager of staffing and community services at Niagara EMS' former home at the Hotel Dieu in St. Catharines when the towers were struck. \n \n\"I remember coming in and getting set for the day and hearing about a plane that had hit the World Trade Center,\" he said. \n \n\"Back then there was no social media. The news was a little sketchy at the beginning.\" \n \nAfter being notified of the second plane attack, Smith went back to the crews quarters and joined paramedics gathered around a TV. \n \n\"It was obvious by that time that this wasn't an accident,\" he said. \n \nSoon after came word of a plane hitting the Pentagon and a fourth crashing into a farmer's field in Pennsylvania. \n \n\"My first thoughts were for the people of New York,\" he said. \n \n\"The classifications of our professions are different - whether it be paramedics, police officer or firefighters - but as emergency allies we watch out for each other but at the same point it's our nature to be concerned about the public we serve.\" \n \nAbout a dozen firefighters from the Niagara Falls Fire Department travelled to New York in October 2001 to attend firefighter funerals and memorials. \n \n\"We are a brotherhood and a sisterhood,\" said deputy fire chief Phil Ross. \n \n\"Any time you lose somebody, you want to be there to acknowledge and honour that person.\" \n \nThe group also attended Ground Zero. \n \n\"The remnants of the tower were still standing and the area that was being searched was at least ten storeys high,\" he said. \"Everyone was actively digging through that pile.\" \n \nNiagara Regional Police Insp. Richard Frayne was among a team of police officers who went to New York City less than three months after the attack to offer peer support to front line emergency workers. \n \n\"They were still recovering bodies, there were still fires burning,\" he recalled. \n \nAccompanied by local mental health workers, the officers, who were all trained in critical incident stress management, would spend upwards of 15 hours a day chatting with New York officers. \n \n\"We spoke to people who were among the first officers on the scene and who had lost a lot of friends and who had seen a lot of terrible things,\" Frayne said. \n \n\"It was a very grounding experience and a very sad experience but it was one of the most important things I've ever done.\" \n \nMeanwhile, Perry visited the site in the fall of 2006. \n \n\"There were a lot of people standing quietly, looking on,\" he said. \"New York City is buzzing all the time and this was like a little pocket of quiet.\" \n \nRoss has visited the site often over the years and has been able to observe the construction of One World Trade Centre, known as the Freedom Tower, and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum. \n \nHe returned last August to enter the finished museum for the first time and saw the names of every person who died in the terrorist attacks inscribed in bronze. \n \n\"It was very surreal to be back in the spot were everything had happened,\" he said.","title":"First responders reflect on 9\/11","media-type":"News","source":"Welland Tribune","published":"2015-09-10T20:03:48Z"}
{"id":"9a95041a-90d6-43f1-b015-89e99437c452","content":"All this month, the Sentinel has been highlighting good things about Central Florida with our \"O-Mazing Orlando\" feature. \n\nAnd as the paper's resident name-taker, I figured I should take \u2014 and share \u2014 a few names myself. \n\nSo for this installment of \"Winning Wednesday,\" I wanted to highlight people who work tirelessly to make Central Florida a better place to live. Some are unsung heroes. Others are selfless advocates. All are fueled by passion. \n\nThis list has 10 people and organizations. But I could rattle off 10 times that many. Literally. After I took to social media to ask readers for their suggestions for unsung heroes, I received more than 100. \n\nThat alone speaks volumes about the community. \n\n\u2022 Andrea Eliscu , mentor and philanthropist. When Eliscu lost her husband to cancer 15 years ago, she had every reason to retreat from the world. Instead, she embraced it: helping underprivileged kids, women with cancer, aspiring medical students and more. Eliscu's most creative endeavor is probably her dragon-boat project, in which kids from Parramore team up with Orlando cops in rowing competitions, learning to row and work together. That effort alone was profiled recently on NBC's \"Today\" show. But she has also helped cancer survivors and helped fund a scholarship for the inaugural class of UCF med-school students \u2026 in her husband's honor. \n \n\u2022 David Odahowski and the Edyth Bush Charitable Foundation. It's hard to overstate the impact this foundation has on our community. We are talking donations of more than $100 million to more than 800 organizations \u2014 bolstering art and culture, promoting education, helping the destitute and more. The CEO, Odahowski, and his foundation do much of their work quietly but with widespread, impressive results. \n\n\u2022 Judy Sarullo of Pet Rescue by Judy. A lot of people have a passion for animals. Few turn that passion into a lifetime pursuit. More than 20 years ago, Judy started her crusade to find homes for unwanted animals in Seminole County. Since then, she has helped place pets all over Central Florida \u2014 a whopping 60,000 of them \u2014 which is why the Sentinel once described Judy as \"patron saint of abandoned, abused and unwanted dogs and cats.\" \n  \n\u2022 Virtually every public defender. They are overworked, outmanned and underpaid. They are scoffed at by some of their rotten clients. They don't get the time they need to work on cases that truly need it, and yet they can be someone's only hope for justice. Their profession is both noble and inglorious. Frontline prosecutors are in similar boats. The balance of justice often rests with people who aren't making enough money to pay off their law-school loans. \n\n\u2022 The Rev. Bill Barnes . Barnes retired this year as senior pastor of St. Luke's United Methodist Church But he leaves behind a legacy that has both changed \u2014 and saved \u2014 lives. Barnes believed that no one should suffer because of a lack of health care. That belief led him to found Shepherd's Hope Ministries, which now provides 21,000 free patient visits each year in clinics throughout Orange and Seminole counties. The reins here have recently been taken over by CEO Marni Stahlman , who will carry on the legacy \u2014 which includes an impressive 1,800 volunteers. \n \n\u2022 Michelle Mangum , director of Seminole Work Opportunity Program for special-needs adults. Michelle's offices are anything but glamorous. They're housed in an old warehouse with a crumbling second floor in a remote part of Seminole County. But there, she presides over a haven and refuge. At SWOP, developmentally disabled adults get a chance to have a job and earn dignity \u2014 at the only facility of its kind in Central Florida. Mangum could make more money elsewhere, but it's hard to imagine she could make more of a difference. \n\n\u2022 Joy Wallace Dickinson . Yes, the Sentinel's Joy Wallace Dickinson. Loudmouth columnists such as I may generate more mail. But week in and week out, Joy provides a service like no one else in Central Florida: sharing the stories of Central Florida's history in her weekend \"Florida Flashback\" column. History is important in any community. But history- tellers are particularly important in a transient community such as ours. Joy continues to fill that role even after retiring from her full-time days here \u2026 and we should all be grateful for that. \n\n\u2022 Bob Kodzis , professional inspirer. I first profiled Bob, a leadership and team-building consultant, a few years back when he began his new life-work model of donating half of all his services to local charities. (The title of the piece: \"He works one volunteer job for every paying one \u2014 and is richer for it.\") Well, it's been three years. And Bob's \"buy one, give one\" lifestyle is still going strong, benefiting nonprofits throughout the region. \n\n\u2022 Lizette Valarino , fulfiller of college dreams. Many students can get accepted to college if they work hard enough. Not everyone can afford to go, though. That was the problem Valarino wanted to solve when she founded the Hispanic Heritage Scholarship Fund. Since she did so in 2000, the fund has provided scholarships to more than 200 students in Central Florida, transforming a whole lot of lives. \n\n\u2022 Donna Dowless , \"Ambassador of Love\" for the city of Orlando. Sure, the title \u2014 bestowed upon her by Mayor Buddy Dyer \u2014 may sound silly \u2026 until you meet Dowless and realize how genuine she is about promoting the upside of the City Beautiful. Dowless is a downtown artist with hip glasses and a cool coif who promotes and embraces all things Orlando and artistic. She's everywhere and all positive, all the time. There's a reason most of her artwork involves hearts. \n\nI have many more winning names to take \u2014 including Dr. Marvin Hardy , singer Mr. Richard , the leadership of Orange County's Legal Aid Society and more. \n\nTo learn more \u2014 or nominate unsung heroes of your own \u2014 visit OrlandoSentinel.com\/takingnames . \n\nsmaxwell@tribpub.com \n Copyright \u00a9 2015, Orlando Sentinel","title":"Winning Wednesday: 10 people who make Central Florida a better place to live","media-type":"News","source":"Orlando Sentinel","published":"2015-09-22T22:42:00Z"}

With Orlando, the big thing is, the higher the challenge is, the higher he's going to go in the game.\" \n \nArcia homered for a third consecutive playoff game, going 2-for-3 with three RBIs and a walk in the Shuckers' 7-1 win over visiting the Chattanooga Lookouts. The victory gave Biloxi a 1-0 lead in the best-of-5 Southern League Championship Series. \n \nThe 21-year-old shortstop, who slashed .307\/.347\/.453 with 52 extra-base hits and 25 stolen bases over 129 Double-A games this year, socked a two-run dinger to left-center field off Chattanooga starter D.J Baxendale in the third inning. \n \n\"Like the previous two, you could tell he got a good pitch to hit,\" Subero said. \"They got him to break his bat [on a first-inning popout], but he made the adjustments and came back and was ready for them.\" \n \nHe singled in a run against Baxendale in the fifth, giving MLB.com's No. 12 overall prospect multiple hits in all of the Shuckers' four playoff games this year. He's 10-for-16 (.625) with 10 RBIs and six runs scored since the semifinals against Pensacola opened on Sept. 10. \n \n\"He had big at-bats. He gets it done when it counts,\" said Arcia's manager. \"That's the kind of player he's been all year. He's been hitting around .370, .380 with runners in scoring position all year. He likes the moment. \n \n\"He [homered on] a fastball in, and he thought they were going to start him with the offspeed. He's always thinking along with the game, looking for sequences. It's not only his talent, it's that he puts himself in a position to succeed. Sure enough, first pitch, they give him a curveball, and -- boop! -- up the middle. That tells you something.\" \n \nMilwaukee's No. 2 prospect Brett Phillips, who was acquired by the Brewers from the Astros in the Carlos Gomez deadline deal , hit his first home run of the postseason after missing the last two weeks of the regular season with an irritated nerve in his thumb. \n \n\"It's been great,\" being able to slot him in the lineup, Subero said. \"He got hurt there for a while and only got to play in two games in Pensacola. We all know about his tools -- he covers a lot of ground in center field, and he's been good. It was good to see him hit that one.\" \n \nThe club's No. 9 prospect Jorge Lopez allowed a run on four hits and a walk while striking out six over seven innings to improve to 2-0 with an 0.66 ERA in the playoffs. He finished the regular season 12-5 with a 2.26 ERA over 24 starts spanning 143 1\/3 Southern League innings. \n \n\"With Jorge, he became a pitcher. He knows how to pitch. He knows what he's got that night. It might not be the changeup, it might not be the curveball, it might not be the fastball early on, but he knows how to work with what he's got,\" Subero said. \"He started that about two-and-a-half months ago, and he hasn't stopped. [Pitching coach] Chris [Hook] has done a tremendous job working with him.\" \n \nThe Shuckers host Game 2 at 8:10 p.m. ET on Thursday. \n\nJosh Jackson is a contributor to MiLB.com.

The trial of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes was not fair because he was the subject of \"poisonous and vile\" social media posts, the NSW appeals court has heard. Hughes is appealing against his conviction and sentence for sexual and indecent assaults on young girls in the 1980s, arguing his trial was a miscarriage of justice.\n\nNSW District Court Judge Peter Zahra sentenced Hughes to a non-parole period of six years, with a maximum term of 10 years, after a jury found him guilty in April last year.\n\nHughes' barrister, Phillip Boulten, SC, told the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on Monday that the trial miscarried in part because of pre-trial publicity and commentary on social media.\n\n\"This was a case where there was ... poisonous vilification of [Hughes] not by mainstream media, but by very persuasive social media that involved the most poisonous and vile publicity from which no one could ever recover.\n\n\"There was a deliberate attempt made by people on social media to poison the well. A lot of the material that was published [was] deliberately contemptuous.\"\n\nMr Boulten said there were social media posts about Hughes, which received \"millions and millions of views\".\n\nMany of the posts were designed to vilify the actor, and did so, the barrister said.\n\nJustice Margaret Beazley, the president of the NSW Court of Appeal, queried whether the court should consider social media posts and mainstream media coverage separately.\n\n\"The mainstream media coverage was comprehensive ... that might be one thing that's not unusual.\n\n\"Social media is another thing. I think we need to look at it separately at least in the first instance.\n\n\"You're going to have to show how social media impacted on the trial.\n\n\"One [form of coverage] was likely to trigger the other. Apart from that, I don't know if there was any connection.\"\n\nMr Boulten also gave a detailed history about one of the complainants in the Hughes trial giving paid media interviews in 2010.\n\nThe court heard the woman and another prosecution witness gave interviews to Channel Nine's A Current Affair and to Woman's Day magazine, in a publicity deal organised by agent Steve Moriarty.\n\n\"[The woman] signed a one-year publicity agreement with him and she was involved in a number of interviews where she received a payment and he received a commission,\" Mr Boulten said.\n\nHughes, who is in Goulburn jail, did not appear in court for his appeal, and did not wish to be on audio-visual link.\n\nThe appeal continues before Justice Beazley, Justice Monika Schmidt and Justice Richard Button. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"Hey Dad! actor Robert Hughes subject of 'poisonous and vile' social media: appeal","media-type":"News","source":"Southern Weekly","published":"2015-09-28T03:06:24Z"}

Reynolds had failed to prove the brands were no more dangerous than brands that have been on the market longer. \n\n\"These decisions were based on a rigorous, science-based review designed to protect the public from the harms caused by tobacco use,\" Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. \"The agency will continue to review product submissions and exercise it's legal authority and consumer protection duty to remove products from the market when they fail to meet the public health bar set forth under law.\" \n\nCongress gave the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes for the first time in 2009.

The global economic divergence which weighed on the US Federal Reserve's decision on Friday to hold rates near zero will be back on show this week with crucial central bank meetings in some of the countries most affected by the Chinese slowdown and weak commodity prices. For starters, some analysts are tipping a second rate cut for the year in Norway, which has been grappling with slower growth and rising unemployment because of the slide in oil prices.\n\nThe Scandinavian country is the world's seventh largest oil exporter, and much of its industrial output is connected with the energy sector. Some analysts see gross domestic product slowing this year to 1.25 per cent from 2.25 per cent last year.\n\nThe response of Norges Bank, the country's central bank, has been to gradually cut the overnight lending rate - known as D-loans - from 2.5 per cent at the end of last year, to 2 per cent now. The policy bank deposit rate, meanwhile, has come down from 1.5 per cent to 1 per cent.\n\nNorges Bank's executive board gathers on Thursday for its scheduled September meeting, with a further cut in the deposit rate in prospect.\n\n\u200b \"We think that the Norges Bank will cut its policy rate from 1 per cent to 0.75 per cent,\" wrote Capital Economics economist Jack Allen.\n\nLike Australia, which relies on commodity exports and Chinese demand for an important part of its growth, Norway has been caught up in the emerging market slowdown wrought by growing imbalances between global supply and demand.\n\nAlthough prices of key minerals and agriculture products have stabilised in recent months, ongoing concerns about the true state of the Chinese economy, added to built-up - and so far unrealised - expectations of start to the first US tightening cycle in almost a decade have fuelled capital flight from commodity-exporter countries.\n\nTellingly, emerging market assets rallied on Friday when the Fed announced its decision to keep interest rates at their historic low of between zero and 0.25 per cent. This, however, is unlikely to last, says analysts.\n\n\"The increased focus on China by the Fed makes the timing of lift-off more uncertain and means an even greater focus will be placed on - sometimes questionable - Chinese monthly economic data,\" said UBS's head of investment strategy Tracey McNaughton.\n\n\"Unfortunately for investors, this therefore means volatility is here to stay a little longer,\" she said.\n\nWhile the decline in commodity countries' currencies has helped exporters and import-exposed companies, some have fallen too far, stoking imported inflation and driving up the cost of US-denominated debt for companies and governments.\n\nBrazil is a case in point. Battered by capital flight, the Banco Central do Brasil has been tightening monetary policy since mid-2013, with a series of increases pushing its reference rates from 7.25 per cent to 14.25 per cent today.\n\nThis tightening comes despite recession in South America's biggest economy, with the subsequent fiscal imbalances leading to a recent cut in Brazil's sovereign credit rating to \"junk\" status.\n\nSouth Africa is another emerging market where investor outflows, and widening current account deficits, have trumped the need to stimulate a slowing economy. Like with Australia, China is South Africa's biggest single trading partner, and softening demand and metals prices have hit the economy hard.\n\n\"We have been affected by China's slowdown,\" Ngoako Ramatlhodi, the country's minister of mineral resources, told journalists in Hong Kong at the weekend\n\n\"Exports have dropped; diamond prices are going down.\n\n\"About 19,000 jobs in the mining industry are at risk,\" he said.\n\nMany analysts are now tipping the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) to hike rates from 6 per cent to 6.25 per cent on Wednesday, although the Fed's decision on Friday may have \"added to the risk of another delay in the SARB's tightening cycle\", according to Capital Economics' economist for Africa John Ashbourne.\n\nAfter losing more than 25 per cent of its value against the US dollar over the past year, the South African rand has begun to strengthen in recent weeks as investor flows return in anticipation of higher rates.\n\nEven the Brazilian real, which has lost more than 60 per cent against the greenback in the past 12 months, received a little boost from the Fed's reluctance to lift rates on Friday.\n\nHowever, the overarching global narrative remains the Fed's concerns about global growth, say analysts, and this will refuel negative sentiment about emerging markets.\n\n\"Global developments are clearly an influence on the Fed's policy moves; that much was again confirmed [on Friday],\" wrote Australia and New Zealand Banking group's economics team.\n\n\"So if that is the main driver of the Fed not hiking, and it seems to be, it is hard to see why the rally in some emerging markets and commodity currencies, which has emerged over recent days, should persist for too long.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"Commodity countries' Fed relief will be short lived","media-type":"News","source":"Summit Sun","published":"2015-09-21T06:32:52Z"}

(Photo: KYLE GRANTHAM\/THE NEWS JOURNAL) \n\nWILMINGTON With mourners still gathering to grieve the loss of Thomas \u201cCannibal\u201d Cottingham, who was stabbed in Rodney Square on Monday as he intervened to protect a mother and her child as they were being chased by a man with a knife, police officers launched a campaign for a more visible law enforcement presence in the square on Friday. \n\nThe New Castle County Police brought out their mounted patrol to be stationed in the square, the heart of the city\u2019s central business district, and Wilmington police officers patroled on bikes and in marked cars. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about combating crime, this is about making people feel safe,\u201d said Col. Elmer Setting, pointing to the six officers on horseback that lined the green Friday morning. \n\nSetting said the county has also launched a mobile patrol unit in Wilmington to bolster the efforts of the city department, but residents and those who were walking around the area on their lunch break seemed drawn to the mounted patrol, coming up to pet the large Clydesdales and snap a photo. \n\n\u201cFor the kids it is just fun,\u201d said Sheila Carn, whose sons Javier and Ezekiel stood in awe looking up at the horses. \n\nWhile her children took in the spectacle, Adam Young, who recently moved to the Residences at Rodney from Philadelphia, said the stabbing just around the corner is disconcerting. \n\nHe said the slaying was a random act that could have happened anywhere, but the fact that it happened around the corner is shocking. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect that to happen,\u201d said Young, who added he thinks the area is a little dangerous. \n\n\u201cEven during the daytime I wouldn\u2019t walk terribly far.\u201d \n\nAaron Stansell, a kitchen managers at Ernest and Scott Taproom, flagged down police after the alleged assailant, Calvin Hooker III, walked by the restaurant. \n\n\u201cI know Wilmington is dangerous,\u201d said Stansell, who was recently robbed at gunpoint near 8th and Orange streets while walking to his car after work one night. \n\n\u201cThey just walked up to me and put a gun to my head,\u201d Stansell said. The robbers got away with $40 and Stansell\u2019s cell phone. \n\n\u201cI think people pretty much know that it\u2019s dangerous and so they don\u2019t live here or come here,\u201d he said. \n\nStansell said he only continues to work here because it is good money. \n\nSheila Carn, who lives in Riverside, said the increased police presence is about safety. \n\n\u201cI think it is good because we need more cops,\u201d Carn said. While she has her own concerns about her neighborhood, Carn said it is also needed in Rodney Square where people congregate and loiter for hours. \n\n\u201cThis is a big population for drugs. People sleep here,\u201d Carn said, admitting she doesn\u2019t take the bus alone at night and tries to leave work before it gets too dark. \n\nIn addition to the stabbing on Monday, a man was shot in the chest on the 800 block of N. West Street in January inside an apartment. The area around Rodney Square typically sees crime like thefts from buildings and robberies, according to city crime data. \n\nFor Haley Peoples and Amy Riddell, who work in the Nemours Building, the presence of police and the mounted patrol are a relief. The women said while they have never been the victims of violence, they know co-workers who have, some having their cell phones stolen as they walked to their cars. \n\n\u201cJust seeing the mounted patrol and knowing that they are there makes you feel better,\u201d Riddell said. \u201cAnd I know is that someone is watching my back.\u201d \n\nPeoples said the violence has made her think twice about working in downtown Wilmington, but hasn\u2019t been enough of a problem to make her leave. \n\n\u201cI have a family to look out for,\u201d Peoples said. \n\nPaige Mikstas, who also works downtown, said she feels unsafe walking and crime is definitely one of the factors keeping her from moving into Wilmington. \n\n\u201cI have friends who live on Market Street and sometimes will stay after work,\u201d Mikstas said. \u201cI think if they don\u2019t live close by, people try to avoid the area after, like, 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.\u201d \n\nMikstas said she is uncomfortable walking around in the city after dark. \n\n\u201cYou just have to take the general precautions like don\u2019t walk around alone, walk fast,\u201d Mikstas said. \u201cMy dad always told me to look pissed off when walking alone and feeling uncomfortable, because then no one will bother you.\u201d \n\nDowntown Visions, a public-private organization aimed at improving the downtown, offers safety escorts for employees walking to their vehicles or to public transportation, to help ease any fears, said Marty Hageman, the organization\u2019s executive director. \n\nBetween July 2014 and June 2015, the \u201csafety ambassadors\u201d were called to 4,556 safety escorts, Hageman said. \n\n\u201cThe number of requests tends to decrease when it is warmer out and increase in the winter, when the sun sets earlier,\u201d he said. \n\nWSFS bank, which employs about 275 people in Wilmington, said they often share safety tips with employees, including encouraging them to use the safety escort services offered by Downtown Visions, said spokeswoman Cortney Klein. \n\nThe Delaware College of Art and Design does the same with students moving into dorms in the Wilmington Campus and provides information for the safety escort program to them. \n\n\u201cWe carry security guards in our buildings and in our residence halls and we have key cards and video monitoring,\u201d said Jason Mokar, director of student services at the school. Mokar said the school has never had any issue with violence or safety concerns, but takes precautions like on any college campus. \n\nThe call for an increased police presence was heard loud and clear from the business community earlier this year as some threatened to consider relocating from downtown. \n\nWilmington Police Chief Bobby Cummings said his department has worked to increase the presence in the central business district, and the help of New Castle County Police will boost the patrol numbers there. \n\nWilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams echoed Cummings, saying the city cannot afford to lose businesses, so there must be a sustained law enforcement effort downtown and there must be an effort to address the homeless who gather as well as those who suffer from drug addiction or mental illness. \n\nThat effort by police hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by businesses, said Richard Heffron, the head of the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. \n\n\u201cI know they are trying,\u201d said Heffron. \n\nMac Nagaswami, CEO of Carvertise, located in the Hercules Building at 1313 N. Market Street, said he and his employees haven\u2019t ever had a problem with crime and feel comfortable walking around downtown. \n\n\u201cThe reality is here in downtown there is such a large visual presence so everybody feels safe,\u201d Nagaswami said. \n\nBut for residents who live in the area, crime is a persistent and serious concern. \n\nBen Cohen, president of the Midtown Brandywine Neighbors Association, said his group has reached out to police asking for additional patrols and surveillance. \n\n\u201cI think we are pretty concerned about crime,\u201d Cohen said, adding that one of his neighbors was held at gunpoint a few weeks ago, but escaped unharmed. \u201cThere is a concern about public safety in the city at the moment.\u201d \n\nMike Hare, senior vice president for Buccini\/Pollin, a development group that has several apartment buildings in downtown Wilmington, including on Rodney Square, said the company polls its residents about living downtown and safety has not been a top issue for most. \n\n\u201cPeople who choose to live downtown are used to more mess than most,\u201d Hare said, adding that any kind of violence is unacceptable and a concern for those who work and live in the area. \n\n\u201cI think some people are shaken by the incident this week,\u201d Hare said. \u201cAs long as these incidents don\u2019t continue and there is an appropriate police response it will be OK. We remain advocates as a company for improved public safety deployment in the city and have long been advocating for mounted patrols to come back, but our goal is to eliminate the concern.\u201d \n\nCohen, whose neighborhood is just a few blocks from Rodney Square said he is encouraged seeing more and more officers on the street. \n\n\u201cI believe they are doing the best they can,\u201d he said. \n\nBrian Lofink, who lives in the Midtown Brandywine neighborhood and works downtown, said right now things seem pretty safe, but if crime continues to increase and move toward his neighborhood, it could be a reason to think about moving out. \n\n\u201cI could see it becoming an issue at some point,\u201d he said. \n\nContact Jenna Pizzi at jpizzi@delawareonline.com or 324-2837. \n\nRead or Share this story: http:\/\/delonline.us\/1F7nA5N","title":"Mounted police deploy downtown to ease fears","media-type":"News","source":"Delaware Online","published":"2015-09-18T23:16:03Z"}

{"id":"ef2da926-8aa8-477e-93a3-5d0d7a38d3c6","content":"SOURCE Affectiva\n\nLatest patent transforms content recommendations with emotion-based personalization\n\nBOSTON \n\n\"Affectiva is the only company in the world with a patent that recommends media content driven by a person's emotional response. We believe this will not only transform how users engage with content and express their preferences, but will also dramatically improve how content providers make recommendations, now that they can personalize experiences based on emotion,\" said Nick Langeveld \n\nThe patent for invention number 9,106,958 entitled \"Video Recommendation Based On Affect\" is for software that analyzes a person's emotional reaction to media content and makes recommendations based on that emotional response. Someone could watch a video and, rather than capture a response by clicking on a star or \"thumbs up\" rating, that person's true, moment-by-moment emotional reaction is captured while the video is playing. Then other content is suggested based on the mood that was elicited by the prior viewing. For example, content provided by YouTube\u2122, Netflix\u2122, Hulu\u2122, or other media publishers could be emotionally ranked as they are watched by numerous people. These emotional responses then serve as input to video recommendation engines. This broad patent also covers the application of emotion-based recommendations in games, movies, educational content, and various other media. \n\nThis invention enables Affectiva to provide the next generation of content feedback, transforming not only how we review, rank and rate digital content, but also how publishers and social platforms will serve up content recommendations.\n\n\"We are inundated with videos and other types of digital experiences. The abundance of digital media makes it hard for us to pick from all these choices,\" says Dr. Rana el Kaliouby, co-Founder and Chief Strategy and Science Officer at Affectiva. \"Our emotions are great drivers of interest, and now with Affectiva's technology, we can get recommendations based on our emotional engagement, truly personalizing our digital experiences.\"\n\nAffectiva has already commercialized some of these capabilities, specifically the ability to measure and analyze at scale a person's emotional response to digital content.

All of which are qualities that Collier Kempton possesses. Despite being born with severe hemophilia A, an inherited bleeding disorder, Collier has remained dedicated to pursuing his interest in running and cycling. And along the way he has inspired others to do the same. \n  \nAffecting approximately 20,000 people in the United States, hemophilia is a rare and life-long condition in which the blood does not clot normally.[1,2] Collier was diagnosed with hemophilia A, the most common form, at a very young age. With the strong support of his family, Collier didn\u2019t let his hemophilia become a game changer. \u201cI never let my condition put me in a box,\u201d explains Collier. \u201cI made sure to live my life and that has set me up for my future.\u201d \n \nFor Collier, a big part of his life has included competitive cycling. At 18-years-old, he competed in a duathlon, which involved both running and cycling. Now at the age of 24, running and cycling are still a big part of Collier\u2019s life as he juggles working as a mechanic at a bicycle shop and coaching high school track. Most afternoons Collier can be found chasing his students at practice, coaching them to train harder and staying in shape himself. He uses his personal experiences to help inspire and build confidence in his team, as well as others with hemophilia. \n \nAnd to help him control and prevent bleeding while keeping active, Collier works closely with his healthcare team to determine the right treatment plan. He is currently uses XYNTHA\u00ae Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) to help control and prevent bleeding associated with his hemophilia. \u201cI needed a treatment what worked for me and fit into my personal routine,\u201d explains Collier. \u201cFor me the XYNTHA Solofuse is easy to use and the travel-ready pack allows me to infuse my treatment where and when I need to.\u201d \n \nCollier shares his story with the hemophilia community in an effort to encourage others to go after what they love. \u201cLive the life you want to live and figure out how to do that within the parameters of your disease,\u201d urges Collier. \n \nFor Collier, this includes taking certain precautions when preparing for physical activity like a long run or cycling. \n \nHere are some tips for staying protected and active with hemophilia: \n \n* Take an honest assessment of your fitness level. While you may not be ready to go for a long distance run yet, you can still take small steps to reach your personal fitness goal And remember, before starting any exercise program, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider. \n \n* Be open with your treatment team about your personal need Discuss the best way to minimize any risk associated with the sport(s) you have chosen and what to do if an injury or bleed occurs. \n \n* Confirm with your physician the timing of your treatment in relation to your activity.[3] \n \nTo learn more about hemophilia you can visit: \n \nhttp:\/\/stepsforliving.hemophiliorg\/ \n \nhttp:\/\/www.hemophiliavillage.com\/ \n \nwww.facebook.com\/OurHemophiliaCommunity \n \nFor more information about XYNTHA and XYNTHA Solofuse, please visit www.xyntha.com . \n \nAbout XYNTHA \n \nXYNTHA\u00ae Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) is indicated in adults and children for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia) and for the prevention of bleeding during surgery in patients with hemophilia A. \n \nXYNTHA does not contain von Willebrand factor and, therefore, is not indicated for von Willebrand's disease. \n \nWe asked patients to tell us about their experiences on XYNTHA. This is Collier\u2019s story. \n \nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR XYNTHA \n \n* Call your healthcare provider or go to the emergency department right away if you have any of the following symptoms because these may be signs of a serious allergic reaction: wheezing, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, turning blue (look at lips and gums), fast heartbeat, swelling of the face, faintness, rash, low blood pressure, or hives. XYNTHA contains trace amounts of hamster protein. You may develop an allergic reaction to these proteins. Tell your healthcare provider if you have had an allergic reaction to hamster protein. \n \n* Call your healthcare provider right away if bleeding is not controlled after using XYNTHA; this may be a sign of an inhibitor, an antibody that may stop XYNTHA from working properly. Your healthcare provider may need to take blood tests to monitor for inhibitors. \n \n* Across all clinical studies, the most common side effects (10% or more) with XYNTHA in adult and pediatric previously treated patients (PTPs) were headache (26% of subjects), joint pain (25%), fever (21%), and cough (11%). Other side effects reported in 5% or more of patients were: diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, and nausea. \n \n* XYNTHA is an injectable medicine administered by intravenous (IV) infusio You may experience local irritation when infusing XYNTHA after reconstitution in XYNTHA\u00ae SOLOFUSE\u00ae. \n \nPlease see full Prescribing Information for XYNTHA and XYNTHA SOLOFUSE. \n \nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

{"id":"b8151915-c2c7-4476-a182-f12994142d54","content":"Q: Hi, Greg. First I want to tell you I enjoy your articles on the older cars and your auto experiences. I still have my 1974 Chevy Malibu Laguna Type S-3 that I bought brand new from the  Ferrario Chevrolet dealership in Wysox, Pennsylvania, back in 1974. I am hoping you can give me some history on this car and its current value. The car is original with 52,000 miles on it. It has the 350 V-8 engine with an automatic transmission. I need to buy some parts for the car that I can\u2019t seem to find. I need rear bumper filler in white and also rubber bumper guards as they are cracking and falling apart.  Thanks very much, Bob Best, Canton, Pennsylvania. A: Bob, thank you very much for your handwritten letter and the kind words. Your Laguna S-3 was produced from 1974 to 1976 on GM\u2019s new Colonnade A-Body platform assembly line, which was also responsible for many of the sibling mid-size Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles and Buicks back then. Your car looks to be an exceptional example of an original 1974 Laguna S-3 where 350, 400 and 454-inch engines still found a home. All engines in 1974 had to adapt to the new smog and unleaded gasoline requirements, effectively lowering compression ratios which resulted in big horsepower losses. Still, your 350 V-8 powered Laguna is quite the attractive car and is one that is getting even rarer for several reasons. First, the 1974 Laguna S-3 was not a big seller that year. Laguna models were expensive as they were sharing much of the interior influences with the Chevy Monte Carlo. This non-robust lack of sales for V-8 and performance cars back then resulted in a new \u201cconsumer code\u201d that pointed to small cars and fuel economy. Thus the mid-size Laguna was not a top choice by any means even though its sibling Chevelle Malibu sold well in six-cylinder and smaller V-8 trim. The good news for a car collector is production numbers, or, better yet, lack thereof.  Of the 312,265 Chevelle Malibu sedans and coupes produced in 1974, only 15,792 were option E37, specifically the new Laguna S-3 V-8 that carried a base price of $3,723. Additionally, it was the Laguna S-3 that replaced the famed Chevelle SS in the Chevy lineup, offering a sleek new body design and those body colored bumpers you now seek. (See the owner\u2019s photo attached.) The second reason for being a rare collector car is plain old attrition. Many Chevelles and Malibus and all other A Body creations ended up at the scrap yard long before muscle cars became popular in the hobby. Personally, I always felt the Laguna S-3 was a great looking car, and because of its aerodynamic design back then, including the slope nose front end models in 1975 and 1976, the S-3 became the car of choice for many top NASCAR teams thanks to its slipstreaming properties at 200 mph. However, NASCAR was hot off eliminating from competition other aerodynamic cars like the 1970 Plymouth Superbird and the Mercury Talladega models, so after the 1976 season they outlaw the slope nose Laguna from further competition. Page 2 of 2 - Overall, GM\u2019s new Colonnade A Body Platform was not too much different than the previous A Body platforms that dated back in 1962. Further, if you look close at the 1966 to 1972 A-Body cars you\u2019ll find the design may have changed quite a bit but the drivetrain did not, minus the lower compression engines. Still, even in a time of corporate crisis in building new small cars, it was the 1974 to 1976 Laguna that featured upgrades in larger disc brakes and a new coil over spring rear suspension setup instead of the solid rear axle. As for current pricing, I\u2019m sad to say the 1974 to 1976 Laguna S-3 will never be what a Chevelle SS454 is today. Current NADA Classic Car values have a 1974 Laguna Type S-3 with a 350 V-8 in at $7,650 in \u201chigh retail\u201d condition, to an \u201caverage retail\u201d of $4,140. I personally feel a Laguna S-3 350 is worth a bit more, and perhaps in the coming years it will increase in value due to its low production numbers. The Laguna 454 with a 4-speed? It\u2019s at around $10,000 in NADA \u201chigh retail\u201d condition, compared to a 1970 Chevelle SS454 with the LS6 engine that lists for a \u201chigh retail\u201d of $159,000 from an original retail of $3,222! Prices like this prove you can\u2019t erase what happened to muscle cars when the gas crisis hit and  manufacturers went to unleaded gas, smog\/emission controls and low compression engines. It just plain killed the collector value of cars from the mid to late 1970 decade. In ending, to find the parts you need I recommend picking up a copy of Auto Round-Up or Hemmings Motor News that cater to the collector car hobby. There are also hundreds of online businesses that cater to restoration of Chevrolet cars and trucks specifically, so if you have a friend or family member with a computer, check it out, and look at eBay too. Thanks for your letter Bob and take care of that rare Laguna S-3. Greg Zyla writes weekly for More Content Now, BestRide.com and other GateHouse Media publications.

That makes Japan the world leader in centenarians, having approximately 61,000, according to the country'sMinistry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.But in a country where longevity is so prized that September 15Seniors Dayis a national holiday in which a silver sake dish is given out to new members of the 100-plus club, it's actually becoming a burden on the nation's economy to live so long. Seniors, though revered, are eating up resourcesat a pace younger generations can't match.Take the September 15 tradition.In 1963, Japan had only 153 centenarians.By 1998, it had 10,000. Today the country puts the totalat 61,568.While the record is no doubt impressive from both a cultural and scientific perspective,the prize pool is becoming cost-prohibitive. In 2014, the awards cost the country approximately $2.1 million. Since the country only seems to be getting older, this year will be the last year Japan gives out the honorary dish, which is valued at roughly $91.Next year's inductees will instead receive a letter congratulating them on the accomplishment.The fall of the sake dish tradition may be Japan's most visible challenge in dealing with its aging population, but it's hardly the largest one.Nationwide, an entire generation of Japanese citizensgoing on two generations, in factare entering retirement age. Of the 127 million people who live there, roughly 25%are over 65. By 2060, that proportion could rise to 40%.WhileBaby Boomers make up a significant portion of the U.S. population,people 65 and older still only make up 13.5% of the overall population.Meanwhile, the generations that are supposed to replace the elderly aren't reproducing. Countries need a \"replacement fertility rate\" of 2.1 births per woman to keep the population from shrinking. Japan's fertility rate is 1.4the resultof women losing interest in Japanese men and the long hours men typically work that precludethem from dating.This dangerous mixture has led some to argue thatJapan is anticipating a \"demographic time bomb.\"(Suddenly a sake dish seem less significant.)Japan's older citizens are working later into their sixties than they used to. Eventually, they will lose theability to work, which means the shrinking generations behind them will be left to boost the economy on their own.That doesn't seem to be happening, as Japan's economy has been deflating for decades.So while the silver sake dish may become affordable again years down the line, as a result of smaller populations getting older, the honor tied to the gesture may lose its luster.Join the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: A Japanese lifestyle guru explains how to organize your home once ' and then never again \nClick here to read full news..","title":"30,000 people in Japan turned 100 this year and the economy can't keep up","media-type":"News","source":"Latest Nigerian News.com","published":"2015-09-16T20:39:31Z"}

Is it better to be in England\u2019s shoes and emerge from the pool stages of the World Cup battle hardened and ready for the knockout stages or, like Ireland, have a more measured buildup with only the one crunch game to hone match fitness before a quarter-final?\n\nI ask because throughout their 24-year wait for a second world crown, New Zealand, almost always the best side in the world when it came to rankings and respect, would frequently bemoan yet another slip-up, blaming the softness of the pool stages that left them a little flabby when it came to meeting the big boys.\n\nWhen you look at some of the cricket scores of old, such as 145-17 against Japan in 1995, you can see what they mean, but set against England\u2019s route this time my guess is that most coaches would prefer not to be facing Fiji first up, followed by Wales and then Australia. From a pool containing four of the top 10 in the current world rankings, something that should never happen, it is probably the most difficult running order, the only easy option, Uruguay, coming probably after the pool has been settled unless point difference settles the group.

Fail and it will be a long night in south-west London.\n\nThe Australia coach, Michael Cheika, said all the right things \u2013 World Cups are meant to be hard, we don\u2019t want any gifts from anyone, etc etc \u2013 this week when he was asked about Pool A. But \u2013 and it\u2019s marginal \u2013 I bet he\u2019s happier with his running order. Fiji, five days after the England match, followed by Uruguay at least gives him the chance to mix and match, whereas by the time England arrive, Lancaster\u2019s side will be heading into their third hard shift on the trot.\n\nNow compare and contrast with Ireland, northern hemisphere champions, on course for their best World Cup \u2013 and that means a semi-final at least \u2013 but still a long way short of their best, if the warm-up against England was anything to go by. Not that it matters, because with Canada and Romania and then Italy up first, that\u2019s a pleasant programme to have in place before they meet France at the Millennium Stadium.\n\nWith Cian Healy being signed off by the Irish medics this week, all Joe Schmidt\u2019s cards seem to be falling into place just at the right time. The prop\u2019s neck injury meant he missed all of Ireland\u2019s warm-up programme and there were fears he would miss the tournament itself, but a couple of games to get back into the swing of the thing is just what the doctor (or coach) would have ordered before that clash in Cardiff in what could be one of the games of the tournament.\n\nPhilippe Saint-Andr\u00e9\u2019s reign as France coach has been less than glorious, but you sense that the final flourish could be the best of it. With a win rate of only a shade over 40% and consistently low ranking in the Six Nations, you might say that won\u2019t be hard, but the two warm-up games against England last month suggested that the long-lost belief of the national side is returning right on time.\n\nRemember, France may not have won the cup, but they have reached three finals and have a happy knack of rising to the occasion and even of undermining All Black World Cup campaigns in the northern hemisphere. Not that they are particularly bad in the southern hemisphere either; the 2011 squad, nominally under Marc Li\u00e8vremont but really being coached by some of the senior players, raised themselves after some shocking pool performances to beat England and Wales and get to within a fingertip of beating New Zealand in the final of their own tournament.\n\nWill it happen again? Well, the first Cardiff quarter-final could easily be a rerun of 2007 when Thierry Dusautoir tackled himself to a standstill and Wayne Barnes endeared himself to the entire All Black nation. The French are a decent outside bet \u2013 they certainly have the power as they showed at Twickenham and against England in Paris \u2013 but in the end you always wonder whether Fred Michalak is the kind of fly-half who can string three big games together.\n\nFinally it\u2019s worth looking at the way the fates have treated Scotland, and you have to say the calendar and the draw have suggested a return to the top eight. Japan and the USA come first, before the might of South Africa, but the crunch comes last in the pool when Vern Cotter\u2019s side and all its new bits have had time to settle in and, being in Newcastle, is conveniently close to the border.\n\nStanding in the way of that quarter-final is Samoa, but it\u2019s not the Samoa of 1991 and 1995. The smile seems to be missing. That kind of island challenge comes from Fiji, who beat Samoa in the Pacific Nations Cup last month, and who set the ball rolling at Twickenham.","title":"England can benefit from Fiji test but their World Cup schedule is envied by no one","media-type":"News","source":"Guardian.co.uk","published":"2015-09-16T13:44:42Z"}

Now in his 20th and perhaps final season, the Lakers organization will be taking careful steps to preserve the Mamba\u2019s health . \n \nHead coach Bryon Scott has faced criticism for playing Kobe extended minutes last season. In an interview with OC Register , Scott admitted he was wrong and will defer to Kobe about his minutes . \n \nScott says he\u2019ll sit down with Kobe to decide whether the Lakers star should play in back-to-backs. \n \nQ. What decisions are you facing with Kobe? \n \n\u00a0 \n \nA. I think the biggest decision is playing time, trying to make that as limited as possible and also back-to-back games. That\u2019s something we have to talk about. Other than that, there really is no other decision to make. He wants to play, and he wants to go out the way he wants to go out \u2014 if this is indeed his final year. He and I have talked a number of times on the phone, we\u2019ve talked about playing time, we\u2019ve talked about back-to-back, we\u2019re going to probably sit down as we get closer to training camp or as we get in training camp and even talk more about it. Because the one thing I want, if this is his last year, I want him to go out standing. I don\u2019t want him to go out hurt. I want to make sure I do everything in my power to make sure we stick to the game plan, as far as his minutes and as far as back-to-back games. \n \n\u00a0 \n \nQ. What do you mean by as \u201climited as possible?\u201d \n \n\u00a0 \n \nA. I didn\u2019t mean play as limited as possible. Obviously we want to keep him as efficient as possible, but I know he knows his body better than anybody. When we start talking about those minutes, I want to listen to him more than anything. I\u2019m not going to go by what I think he can play like I did last year, I want to really go by what he thinks he can play.

At initial launch in August, the company had not anticipated just how popular the straps were going to be, and they quickly sold out. The stock has been replenished to make sure everyone would be able to get the hammock straps.\n\nNature\u2019s Hangout\u2019s Mark Haden says: \u201cOur new hammock straps were more popular than we originally expected. Only 5 weeks after our initial launch of the product, we sold out! We scrambled with our manufacturer to get more made, but still were out of stock for several days.\u201d\n\nIt took just one week after its release for the straps to become a bestselling item. The product remains very popular, and numerous requests for more stock came in during the few days that none were available. The company is now committed to being able to keep up with demand now that they have a better understanding of how popular the straps actually are.\n\nOne of the main reasons why these straps have become so popular is because they are tree-friendly. An increasing number of parks where campers go to have outlawed hammocks that use traditional straps, ropes or screws. This is because those straps are able to cause significant damage to a tree and its bark. The hammock straps from Nature\u2019s Hangout, by contrast, have been designed to protect the tree, even with repeated use.\n\nAnother thing that has been much appreciated is the ease of use of the straps. \u201cStraps came quickly, they were just what was stated in description,\u201d says one customer. \u201cMy 15 yr old took them out, unwrapped and set up his hammock without asking a single question\u2026easy!!\u201d\n\nThe straps also come in an easy to carry bag. This enables people to take the straps with them wherever they go, be that on a camping trip or a day out at the beach. Additionally, since the straps have been designed for prolonged use, some people simply use them to attach a hammock in their garden and leave it there.\n\n###\n\nContact Nature\u2019s Hangout:\n\nMark Harden\n\n5052598542\n\nhelp@natureshangout.com\n\n25 Snowline Norte\n\nCedar Crest, NM 87008 \n\nReleaseID: 60","title":"Best Selling Hammock Straps Back In Stock","media-type":"News","source":"WSFA","published":"2015-09-04T18:39:00Z"}

The old retaining wall on the south side of the Pierce School Lofts is being rebuilt, and the developers are taking extra pains to make sure it complements the historic district. \n\n\u201cIt was rotted railroad ties and crumbling concrete,\u201d said Tim Baldwin, who is partnering with Pat Sherman to transform the old school. \u201cWe\u2019re using manufactured block that is made to look like cut stone. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll apply an acid etch and stain to give it a limestone color.\u201d \n\nThe project, which is getting $708,000 in housing tax credits through Iowa\u2019s Economic Development Authority, has a total price tag of $8 million to $9 million. \n\nWhen finished next summer, the property at 2212 E. 12th St., will contain 41 housing units. \n\n\u201cEverything is getting state and federal approval, because of the tax credits,\u201d Baldwin said Thursday. \u201cWe can\u2019t use the credits for the new wall or the parking lot, though.\u201d \n\nThe Economic Development Authority has a specific list, called Qualified Reimbursable Expenses, for the portions of the project where tax credits can be used. Other rules also apply, and the partners have made changes to the development to make sure they comply. \n\n\u201cWe really wanted to do a rooftop deck,\u201d Baldwin said of the portion of the school that was added to the historic property in the 1970s. \u201cWe thought it would be a beautiful viewing area for the turn on the (Quad-City Times) Bix 7.\u201d \n\nBut it was not possible to provide access to the roof that would comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, he said. \n\n\u201cInstead, we\u2019ve designed the parking-lot layout in a way that creates a space for permanent bench seats with historic features around it,\u201d Baldwin said. \n\nWhen finished, Pierce School Lofts will contain large, primarily one- and two-bedroom apartments. The units will be considerably larger, Baldwin said, than those inside the former Democrat building on Brady Street, which Baldwin and Sherman also rehabbed. \n\nThe pair recently decided to add a studio unit, because the smaller, less-expensive living options have become increasingly popular in historic makeovers, Baldwin said. \n \n\u201cThe one bedrooms can go for $900 plus and the two-bedroom units can run from $1,300 to $1,400,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lower studio pricing is in demand.\u201d \n\nThe target date for opening Pierce was June 2016, but the project is ahead of pace. \n\n\u201cAs it stands now, we\u2019re running a couple months early,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWe could hit some snags in the winter, but we\u2019re in good shape now. \n\n\u201cEverything is framed in, and we\u2019ll be hanging (sheet) rock in the next couple of months, and the electrical, plumbing and HVAC are roughed-in.\u201d \n\nBaldwin said he has been \u201cdisheartened\u201d by one element of the work: Someone has been shooting a BB gun through some of the windows, which have been, \u201cliterally re-handcrafted. \n\n\u201cEventually, the building is going to have a sophisticated security system, but, for now, we\u2019ve asked the police to help us keep an eye on things. \n\n\u201cThis project is going to clean up the neighborhood so much.\u201d","title":"Historic Pierce School project showing some progress","media-type":"News","source":"QC Times","published":"2015-09-07T18:06:00Z"}

He tried to lose weight all the time\u2014every week, he engaged in a new diet, some more successful than others, but nothing stuck. \n \n\u201cIn every corner of our house, there was no wall space,\u201d Lerman says. \u201c[Each wall] was either lined from floor to ceiling with diet books or shirts that represented my dad\u2019s different weights. There was a pile: 185, 195, 205, 215, 225.\u201d \n \nLerman, a nutrition expert, cooking teacher, and Upper West Side mom-of-two, reflects on her tumultuous childhood relationship with food and how it affected her relationship with her family in her recent memoir, aptly named My Fat Dad . In the book, she describes how her creative family\u2014her mother and sister were actresses, and her father worked in advertising as a writer and creative director, responsible for iconic slogans such as \u201cLeggo My Eggo\u201d and \u201cFly the Friendly Skies\u201d\u2014was always obsessing over food, but never in a healthy way. Her dad would diet, then maybe eat an entire pizza, then switch diets, while her mom would prepare either processed foods or nothing at all. It was Lerman\u2019s grandmother who showed Lerman that, when prepared correctly, food could be a source of joy rather than stress. \n \nLerman\u2019s grandmother, whom people called Beauty, cooked traditional Jewish meals and encouraged making food into art rather than temporary sustenance. She and Lerman would sit down for meals, and no matter what they\u2019d cooked, it would be set out on a nice plate, perhaps served with tea, and the two would eat \u201clike ladies.\u201d \n \n\u201cMy grandmother really drilled it into my head that food is love, food is happiness, [and] everything has to have a smell,\u201d \u00a0 Lerman says. \u201cIf it smells, if it has an aroma\u2014it\u2019s going to transform your world.\u201d \n \nOnce Lerman\u2019s family moved from Chicago when she was 9, and she left Beauty behind, it was harder to stay positive. But Beauty would send recipe cards to Lerman at her new home in New York City. \n \n\u201cMy grandmother\u2019s recipe cards saved my life because it kept me from getting in trouble. Every week I had this purpose and this mission,\u201d Lerman says. \u201cI had to go home, I had my recipe cards, I had to cook them for my sister\u2026and I knew I had to take care of myself because nobody else would.\u201d \n \nLerman combined teachings from all the cooks in her life, whether it be Beauty\u2019s \u201cthrow it in\u201d style or her baker Aunt Jeannie\u2019s carefully-measured approach, to take care of her own family. Her memories of Jeannie\u2019s healthy \u201cswaps\u201d (like switching butter with applesauce) helped inspire Lerman to start her nutrition awareness program, Magnificent Mommies , which offers workshops to create healthier lifestyles for young children and their adults. \n \nBut despite food\u2019s looming presence in her formative years, Lerman\u2019s path to becoming a nutritionist wasn\u2019t exactly direct. She went through several professions first, including acting, producing commercials, and working as a school drama therapist with kids who suffered from ADHD, depression, and low self-esteem. \n \n\u201cWhile working at the school, I realized how important proper food choices were,\u201d she says. \u201cI worked with kids on the importance of food choices, made snacks with them, and helped parents to add nutrient-loaded food into their children\u2019s diets and get rid of sugar preservatives and artificial additives.\u201d However, it wasn\u2019t until a couple of years later, when her dad was diagnosed with cancer, that Lerman went back to school to study nutrition. \u201cI realized helping people heal through food choices was my true calling,\u201d she says. \n \nThis creative yet practical approach that Lerman brought to her students guides how she cooks for her own children, as well. On her daughter\u2019s first day of preschool, Lerman noticed how many of her classmates were eating unhealthy snacks. She started a blog, \u201c Snacking Outside the Box ,\u201d for sharing her healthy recipes and cooking tricks, and started to bring treats into her daughter\u2019s classroom to show that healthy cooking could taste good. \n \n\u201cMy daughter went to a preschool on the border of Harlem where many of the kids had never seen edamame or an avocado,\u201d she says. \u201cWe made guacamole and edamame hummus. By teaching them to cook, we turned thier yucks into yums.\u201d \n \nAfter her blog gained traction, Lerman tried to sell it as a book idea. But the response she received was largely: \u201cThat\u2019s not your story. We want to hear about your family.\u201d So she began writing about growing up with her fat dad for the New York Times\u2019 \u00a0 \u201cWell\u201d blog , and the posts formed the basis for the book. \n \nLerman was a little hesitant to explore her relationship with her father. She sent him chapters after she\u2019d finished writing them so he could look them over, and calls the process \u201cnerve-wracking.\u201d However, her father\u2019s response after reading the book was: \u201cYou\u2019ve come a long way baby,\u201d a tagline he\u2019d created for Virginia Slims. \n \nLerman has found that her story resonates with many; she\u2019s received letters from people all over the world who\u2019ve had a grandmother like Beauty or who had a parent who wrestled with extreme dieting. \n \n\u201cMy story is everybody\u2019s story, and it could be your story, so the most important thing is trying to create good food memories around your kids, and be aware of the message you send to your children,\u201d Lerman says. \u201cInstill a love for food: For buying food, making food, eating food, and valuing what it does for your body.

Dhowan and Defence Secretary G. Mohan Kumar. \n \nParrikar said an order implementing the scheme was likely to come in a fortnight to a month. \n \nThe minister squarely blamed the previous Congress-led government for miscalculations on OROP, and said it led to the delay in its implementation. \n \nHe also quoted a reply by a former minister of state for defence in parliament in 2009, who had said \"there are administrative, technical and financial difficulties in implementing OROP\". \n \n\"It is for these reasons that the present government took some time to fulfill its promise,\" he said. \n \nThe estimated cost to the exchequer for the scheme will be Rs.8,000-10,000 crore, and the arrears will amount to around Rs.12,000 crore. \n \nThe scheme announced by the government will take 2013 as the base year to calculate pensions. \n \n\"Pensions will be re-fixed for all pensioners retiring in the same rank and with same length of service as the average of minimum and maximum pension in 2013,\" Parrikar said. \n \nThose drawing pension above the average will be protected. \n \nParrikar said the government came to power on May 26, 2014 and the budget came in June, so the date of implementation will be immediately after that, which was July 1, 2014. \n \nThe period for review is five years, something that has been a major sticking point. \n \nAnother major issue is that the government's scheme is not for those who seek voluntary retirement, even though Parrikar said that those who are forced to take retirement due to injuries obtained during service will be protected. \n \nThe arrears are to be paid in four instalments, at a gap of every six months. \n \nTo war widows, the arrears will be given in one instalment. \n \nRao Inderjit said veterans above 60 years of age will also get arrears in one go. \n \nAnnouncing the scheme, Parrikar said the government was dedicated to the scheme which has been pending for \"40 years\". \n \n\"The issue of OROP has been pending for nearly four decades. It is a matter of deep anguish that various governments remained ambivalent on the issue of OROP,\" said Parrikar. \n \nProtesting ex-servicemen on Saturday said they were not \"fully satisfied\" with the OROP scheme announced by the government as all of their demands were not met. \n \n\"Though we welcome the implementation of the OROP by the government, we are not fully satisfied as they have not accepted the six points demanded by the ex-servicemen,\" Maj. Gen. Satbir Singh (retd), who has been spearheading the campaign for OROP, told the media at Jantar Mantar shortly after Parrikar's announcement. \n \nHe said a decision on the future course of their agitation would be taken later in the evening. \n \nIn the government press conference, Parrikar blamed the previous Congress-led government, saying they promised implementation of OROP in 2014-15, but \"did not specify what OROP would be, how it will be implemented or how much it will cost\". \n \n\"An estimated Rs.500 crore provided for OROP in the budget presented in February 2014 by the then government was not based on any calculation,\" he said. \n \n\"The reality, however, is that to implement OROP the estimated cost to the exchequer would be Rs.8,000 to Rs.10,000 crore at present, and will increase further in future,\" he said.","title":"Government announces OROP, veterans not satisfied","media-type":"News","source":"Yahoo!

The worker died when a ceiling collapsed. \n \nDr Busuttil issued his statement after the prime minister two Sundays ago asked if action would be taken against the former minister in view of the fact that the PN had demanded the resignation of the justice minister after a traffic accident in which a man was injured and the minister ended up in court. \n \nIn a statement, Dr Busuttil said: \"I have reached the conclusion that, until the court pronounces its judgement, no action should be taken against Francis Zammit Dimech by the party for the following reasons: \n \n\"Dr Zammit Dimech was not involved in what happened in any manner whatsoever. He was a non-Executive Director with no direct or indirect involvement in the running of the company that owns the hotel where building works took place. \n \n\"Dr Zammit Dimech does not occupy an executive role in Government. It would have been different if he were a minister. But he is not. There is therefore no role of responsibility to dismiss him from. \n \n\"The incident was not even remotely connected with Dr Zammit Dimech\u2019s parliamentary and political duties or even with his past ministerial duties and therefore dismissal from the party is not warranted.\" \n \nDr Busuttil said Dr Zammit Dimech \"is showing strength and resolve in this difficult time and I stand four-square behind him.\" \n \nHe said he had communicated his decision to the Parliamentary Group which supported it unanimously.","title":"Busuttil stands by Francis Zammit Dimech: 'Dismissal from the party is not warranted'","media-type":"News","source":"Times of Malta","published":"2015-09-05T15:32:00Z"}

{"id":"04a9e376-12cb-486d-a462-9bba925c2af9","content":"A compound found in breast milk, named fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), plays a key role in neonatal nutrient absorption and intestinal function. FGF21 also contributes to improve newborn growth and metabolic profile.\n\nThis is the main conclusion of the project \u201cStudy of FGF21 as a new factor present in breast milk and involved in the benefits of breastfeeding\u201d, included in the programme of excellent research RecerCaixa, an initiative organised by the Obra Social \u201cla Caixa\u201d together with the Catalan Association of Public Universities (ACUP). The results of the study have been published in the journal Scientific Reports of the Nature Publishing Group by a scientific team led by Francesc Villarroya, professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Barcelona (UB), together with the Biomedical Research Networking Centres on Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBERobn) and the Danone Institute.\n\nFGF21 is a hormonal factor produced mainly in the liver. The factor is present in the human body in a natural manner, even if in some people it is more active than in others. To date, it was known that it plays important roles in favouring glucose uptake and energy metabolism, and thus possesses anti-diabetic and anti-obesity properties. The research study led by Dr Villarroya, director of the Institute of Biomedicine of the UB (IBUB), has proved that oral infusion of FGF21 to neonatal gut induces the gene expression of intestinal hormones and increases intestinal lactase activity and lactose absorption.\n\nAnimal models indicate that metabolic profile and growth is 25% better in neonates who receive the factor than in those who do not receive it. In order to come to this conclusion, researchers analysed the differences between a group of pups nursed with milk containing FGF21 and another group of pups nursed with milk lacking FGF21.\n\nIn a previous study developed together with the Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, the team led by Dr Villarroya found that FGF21 levels are very low in fetuses, but the blood levels of FGF21 rise dramatically after birth and the initiation of suckling. This fact proves the importance of maternal breast feeding.\n\nFurther studies will be required to confirm these findings in human neonates. Researchers will analyse the long-term effects that having been exposed to FGF21 has on the metabolism until adolescence, as well as the presence of the factor in formula feeding in order to optimize biotechnological formula designs to fulfil the complexities of optimal milk composition and mimic the properties of breast milk.

{"id":"e2bb7ca9-b99c-411e-b094-4ba1e84b5ea8","content":"By STATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE \n\nBOSTON -- Uber, Lyft and taxicab drivers showed up by the hundreds at the State House on Tuesday as lawmakers began to consider proposals to regulate the booming ride-hailing industry, including Gov. Charlie Baker's attempt to thread the needle between protecting public safety and encouraging innovation. \n\nWith the Financial Services Committee preparing to consider four major bills this fall that would regulate so-called transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft, lawmakers are grappling with issues ranging from making sure for-hire cars are adequately insured to ensuring that drivers present no threat to the public. \n\nPublic Safety Secretary Dan Bennett, testifying first on Tuesday, told members of the committee that Baker's bill would impose \"one of the strongest state level background checks in the country\" among states that have tried to regulate the smartphone-driven industry. \n\nThe bill (H 3351) proposes a two-part background check for drivers, including a national check done by the company and a comprehensive state check that would include a criminal and sex offender registry check, as well as driving history. \n\n\"No other state has adopted this type of belt and suspenders system,\" Bennett said. \n\nWhile Bennett emphasized safety, Assistant Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship Katie Stebbins said Baker's bill was also \"pro-business, pro-consumer and pro-innovation.Advertisement \" \"Disruption is a hallmark of innovation,\" Stebbins said. The governor's bill, she said, seeks to level the playing field while also avoiding the type of overregulation, like pricing controls, that could stifle growth in the industry. \n\nIn addition to background checks, Baker's bill would require Uber and Lyft drivers to have a minimum $1 million insurance policy for death, injury and property damage that would kick in only when the driver had their app on, was driving to pick up a customer or had a passenger in the car. It will be up to the companies themselves how much of the insurance costs the drivers will have to shoulder. \n\nBecause the TNC drivers use their personal vehicles for commercial purposes, the administration said it was important to distinguish between when the car was being used for business and personal use. The hybrid insurance product, which is currently sold by a company in Virginia, exceeds the requirements for taxi drivers, officials said. At least one company has proposed selling a similar type of policy in Massachusetts. \n\nUber and Lyft drivers, wearing blue and pink T-shirts respectively, packed the grandstand of the Gardner Auditorium where the air was thick with humidity. Cab drivers wearing yellow T-shirts filled the lower seating area, and periodic cheers and boos erupted from both groups as lawmakers and the administration discussed the proposals. \n\nUber and other groups, including Associated Industries of Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council, are supporting Baker's bill as opposed to separate legislation filed by Rep. Michael Moran and Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry, both of Boston, that would impose stricter regulations on the ride-hailing services. \n\nThe Moran-Forry bill (H 3702) would, among other things, require a system of fingerprint background checks that Bennett said would be too \"cumbersome\" to implement. The Moran-Forry bill also encourages some oversight of Uber's \"surge pricing\" system, which charges passengers higher rates at peak hours to encourage more drivers to meet the demand. \n\nBaker officials said the state should not interfere with pricing, but rather allow consumers and the market to police itself. \n\nAngela O'Connor, chairwoman of the Department of Public Utilities, argued in favor of giving the regulatory oversight to the DPU, which currently regulates other commercial drivers, and said broad regulatory authority would allow the DPU to respond in the future to a rapidly changing industry. \n\nThe department envisions starting with five new employees to oversee background checks and other functions, and would plan to purchase a database to track permitted drivers. Funding for oversight would come from an assessment on the transportation network companies. \n\nAs lawmakers probed the rationale for the insurance and background check recommendations, Rep. James Cantwell, a Marshfield Democrat, raised the issue of car markings as he described a constituent who had strangers jump in his car at the airport thinking it was an Uber. \n\nBaker's bill does call for cars to be marked, but Bennett did not elaborate on what that would look like. \n\nRep. Shawn Dooley, a Norfolk Republican, also raised a concern about the proposed five-day window for the DPU to perform its background check on new drivers. If the state check is not finished in time, the driver would be provisionally approved to start driving, Bennett said. \n\nDooley said he wanted to see a policy where the driver could be provisionally disapproved if something out of the control of the DPU prevented them from completing the background check. \n\n\"I don't care if it's a one-in-a-million chance, I don't want that guy out picking up my daughter from college,\" Dooley said. \n\nBefore the hearing, taxi drivers from the Greater Boston area congregated outside the State House to make their opinions known. \n\nEugene Larrame, who said he has driven a cab in Cambridge for 33 years, was one of about 15 drivers wearing yellow T-shirts that said \"I'm a cab driver and I vote\" on the back. \n\nLarrame said the state allowing \"transportation network companies\" like Uber and Lyft to have free reign is similar to a parent allowing one child to run wild. \n\n\"Let's say you have four or five kids. One of them, you let them do whatever they want. What is going to happen, are you going to have a good kid?\" he asked. \"Probably not. It's the same thing happening here.\" \n\nDuring a radio interview on WGBH Tuesday, Attorney General Maura Healey outlined her general considerations. \n\n\"I think that today's discussion, debate is really important,\" she said. \"Look, this is a new industry, it is part of the new on-demand economy and, you know, as with any new sort of industry it is going to take some time and conversations and dialogue to figure out sort of the best path forward here. I know the Baker administration has put forward legislation and there are a few other bills out there pending. It's a really good discussion.\" \n\nHealey added, \"First public safety should be protected. We want to make sure that as people use this service or are picked up by Uber or Lyft drivers that their public safety is protected and ensured . . . It speaks to background checks and measures such as that and it also is important that consumers are protected and that's what some of the discussion has been about. But, you know, I welcome the discussion and I'm looking to learn more, it's obviously not an area the attorney general has any direct oversight or regulation of and I think it's important.\" \n\nAsked by Boston Public Radio host Jim Braude why she couldn't issue ride industry regulation, like she did with e-cigarettes, Healey said, \"This is a power and authority that exists within the Department of Public Utilities actually, a different state agency and I respect that. I respect the work of the Legislature and their efforts to engage in this discussion and debate. Look, it's not just here in Massachusetts, it's a debate, it's a discussion that we've seen nationally and as I said, I'm looking to learn more.\" \n\nHealey said she's used Uber and Lyft and likes both services. \n\n[Colin Young contributed reporting]","title":"Level playing field at center of ride industry debate","media-type":"News","source":"Lowell Sun","published":"2015-09-15T19:51:20Z"}

{"id":"6544e111-3e51-45bf-952f-7d3d9791b8a8","content":"\u00a0 \n \n1. LIE TO YOUR ATTORNEY \n There is wisdom in the old adage \"honesty is the best policy\". \u00a0My goal is to present your story to the jury. \u00a0To do this well, I must rely upon what you tell me along with the information I gather from interviewing witnesses and examining the physical evidence. \u00a0My cross examination of the people testifying against you will be based, in part, on what you tell me about them and the case. \u00a0I firmly believe that it only takes one mistake in our case for the prosecutor to turn the jury against you and argue we simply playing with \"smoke and mirrors\". \u00a0So, please, be honest with me. \u00a0Let's look at this another way. Pretend you're at the doctor for a routine physical but you've been suffering from severe headaches for the last few weeks. If you didn't tell your doctor about your constant headaches, a possible tumor could go undiagnosed. The results could be disastrous: you could die. \u00a0The same goes with us. \u00a0When it comes to your case, tell us everything. \u00a0Otherwise, you increase the risk of going to jail or not receiving maximum payment for your injuries.  \n\u00a02.\u00a0DON'T DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD \n I will probably give you a list of things to do that will help me defend you. \u00a0It can be something simply as providing me the names and addresses of your witness or making sure you do the assignments requested by the court necessary for resolving your case. If wither our office or the court gives you a task, make sure that it is done and done on time. \u00a0If you stand in front of a judge and have not done what you were asked to do by either the court or our firm, that doesn't do either of us any good. \u00a0It could result in plea bargains being withdrawn or, worse, the judge ordering you to jail.  \n\u00a0 3.\u00a0GET ARRESTED \n A new arrest can be a \"case killer.\" \u00a0Judges do not like \"pregnant defendants\"-meaning that they don't want to see you keep adding more cases to their docket while your first case is still pending. Our experience has taught us that civil juries award less money to plaintiff's wearing orange jumpsuits. Criminal clients get bail revoked and the new arrest negatively affects the older prosecution. If it isn't obvious, let me be clear: \u00a0it is a standard condition of bail that you remain arrest and conviction free. Also, keep this in mind: \u00a0additional legal problems could also mean more attorney fees, since there would be more work to do.\u00a0\u00a0  4. MISS COURT  This is bad. \u00a0Failure to appear in court results in a bench warrant for your arrest, revocation of your bond, and possibly 6 months in jail for contempt of court. Make sure you show up. \u00a0If you're not sure of the date, call our office and we'll tell you the date, time and place. \u00a0If it's an emergency, let us know immediately. \u00a0With enough time, it's possible we can help you reschedule your court date or get permission to waive your appearance. \u00a0Do not simply fail to appear because you have not followed an instruction or would fail a drug tests. \u00a0Admittedly, those are serious problems but you will make that situation much worse if you simply fail to show up. \u00a0Two wrongs won't make a right.  5. TALK ABOUT YOUR CASE WITH YOUR FRIENDS  The reality is phones can be tapped. \u00a0So-called \"friends\" can wear wires. \u00a0Private investigators can snap pictures. \u00a0Anyone could kill your case. \u00a0I've lost 2 defensible federal gun cases because my clients were recorded on the jailhouse phone admitting possession of the guns and trying to obstruct justice by having others claim ownership of them.

They're tied atop the East Division and will also meet Friday night at Rogers Centre. THE CANADIAN PRESS\/Peter Power \n\u2014\u00a0image credit: \n  \nBy Dan Ralph, The Canadian Press \n\nHAMILTON - It goes back 65 years and spans 44 games but defensive end Ricky Foley believes the Toronto Argonauts-Hamilton Tiger-Cats Labour Day rivalry has never been better. \n\nToronto (6-3) and Hamilton (6-3) meet Monday afternoon at Tim Hortons Field with more than just bragging rights on the line. They're tied atop the East Division and will also meet Friday night at Rogers Centre. \n\nThis marks just the second occasion Toronto and Hamilton will be battling for top spot in the East on Labour Day and the first time they'll be playing for sole possession of first place. The season series \u2014 which would break any season-ending tie in the standings \u2014 will also be decided with the Ticats having won the first meeting 38-14 last month. \n\nAnd with Tim Hortons Field being a sellout, the atmosphere Monday will undoubtedly be electric. \n\n\"I think it (Labour Day rivalry) is stronger now,\" Foley said. \"Hamilton has been in back-to-back Grey Cups and we're the last team from the East to win the Grey Cup (2012). \n\n\"Both teams are at the top (of the East Division) so it's amped up, more intense. And the new stadium, Tim Hortons Field, helps a lot because that's a crazy atmosphere.\" \n\nFoley embraces being Public Enemy No. 1 in Hamilton. \n\n\"I wish every game was like that,\" said the 10-year veteran and top Canadian in Toronto's 2012 Grey Cup victory. \"I wish every game was sold out, people crazy screaming and yelling at you telling you that you're no good. \n\n\"I love that. That's what you play for, that kind of atmosphere. This is huge, absolutely huge, the biggest game of the year. That's no overstatement at all.\" \n\nHamilton opened Tim Hortons Field with a 13-12 Labour Day win over Toronto last year. The Ticats reeled off 10 straight victories there before losing a 26-23 decision to Montreal on Aug. 27. \n\n\"Coming off a loss we still have a sour taste in our mouth,\" said Ticats quarterback Zach Collaros, the CFL passing leader who began his career with Toronto in 2012. \"I'm just excited to be out there competing no matter who it's against, it just happens to be a rival and Labour Day and so it's a big one.\" \n\nToronto is also coming off a loss, 38-15 in Edmonton on Aug. 28, and is just 13-30-1 on Labour Day in Hamilton. But the Argos are 5-4-1 in their last 10 Labour Day clashes despite their last road win in Steeltown coming in 2012. \n\n\"Our guys understand the next two games are against who they're against,\" Toronto head coach Scott Milanovich said. \"I can hide it as much as I want but they understand what's in front of them and how quickly it's in front of them. \n\n\"They know the next few days are going to be pivotal to where we're at going down the stretch. I still think the only way to approach it is get the first one and they worry about playing the second game.\" \n\nHamilton coach\/GM Kent Austin said rivalry games are important in football. \n\n\"It's what makes football fun,\" he said. \"You need rivalry games, for sure, otherwise it would be a lot more boring. \n\n\"Our players understand (what's at stake) and we're counting on, I'm sure like they are, guys who've played in this game before to communicate that. Accountability and preparation have to come from within the team, it can't come from the coaching staff.\" \n\nVeteran quarterback Ricky Ray returns to Toronto's roster after missing the first nine games following off-season shoulder injury. But backup Trevor Harris, the CFL leader in TDs (19) and passing efficiency (112.7), will make his 10th straight start and says ball security is key against an opportunistic Hamilton defence. \n\nThe Ticats defence has scored eight touchdowns (six interceptions, two fumble returns) and lead the CFL in takeaways (32), interceptions (14) and turnovers on downs (11). Hamilton has scored 121 points off turnovers this season. \n\n\"They're playmakers, they're fast, they're always on the same page,\" Harris said. \"It's one of those deals where if you throw one up they're going to pick it, if you fumble they're falling on it and probably scoop and score. \n\n\"You have to limit your mistakes, make sure you're mentally in every single play because if you're not they will capitalize.\"","title":"Foley: Argos-Ticats Labour Day rivalry solid","media-type":"News","source":"IndulgeMagazine.ca","published":"2015-09-06T23:30:06Z"}

Both  charge users based on metered consumption of chilled water. Residents, however, are questioning a new \u201cinfrastructure service charge\u201d that they claim has resulted in huge increases to their monthly bill. \n \n\u201cIn effect, this has increased our monthly chilled water charge by between 50 and 300 per cent,\u201d said Briton M\u2009W, who has been living in Al Zeina for a year. \u201cIn my case, it\u2019s a 132 per cent increase.\u201d \n\nThe 60-year-old was paying an average of Dh260 a month to Dimarco compared with the Dh600 a month he now pays to Tasleem. He said that 33 per cent of the amount was because of the infrastructure charge. \n \n\u201cWithout Tasleem\u2019s infrastructure charge, it would still be a 35 per cent increase over Dimarco,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the warmer weather of late, I could accept this. I would liken this to staying in a hotel, then having my room rate doubled to cover hotel maintenance.\u201d \n\nA Dutch tenant in Al Zeina said the charges should be based on consumption only. \n\nHer Tasleem bill amounted to Dh332 of which Dh44.09 was the metred usage. Dh288 was the infrastructure charge. \n \n\u201cThe more you use, the more you pay,\u201d I\u2009S said. \u201cAlso, this would mean that clients that are environmentally conscious are better off.\u201d \n\nAn Al Muneera resident said he used to pay Dimarco between Dh1,000 and Dh1,200 a year for consumption charges on a three-bedroom apartment, with no fixed monthly fee. \n\n\u201cWe used to pay Dimarco Dh60 during the normally hot months and Dh150 during the hotter months,\u201d said  A\u2009L, 40. \n \n\u201cMy bill for July was Dh354, Dh66 of which was for consumption and Dh288 for what they call the infrastructure service charge,\u201d the Italian said. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. You cannot change the company name, provide the same service and ask four times more than what we were paying before.\u201d \n\nEmirati A\u2009A, however, said he had experienced a drop in prices. \u201cI have owned a villa in Al Raha Gardens since 2010 and in comparison to last year\u2019s June\/July bill of Dh1,800, I have seen it drop this year to Dh1,200.\u201d \n \nA Tasleem spokesman said the infrastructure charge was \u201cnot an additional charge levied by the company, and had always been part of the overall cooling fees paid by consumers\u201d. \n\n\u201cTasleem has separated the infrastructure service charge from the consumption charge to bring greater transparency to customers\u2019 invoices,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fee structure is a  standard industry practice, and is in line with global benchmarks.\u201d \n \nResidents also complained of being required to pay a Dh3,000 deposit, 300 per cent more than that charged by Dimarco. \n\nrruiz@thenational.ae","title":"Abu Dhabi residents concerned over excessive utility charges","media-type":"News","source":"Abu Dhabi National","published":"2015-09-07T17:40:19Z"}

Six of the suspects face riot and assault charges stemming from yet another incident, a violent confrontation on Delafield Street April 25. \n \nThe announcement of the arrests, coming just before the start of the college football season, is yet another mark against Rutgers athletics, at a particularly bad time for head coach Kyle Flood . It is also another test for the Middlesex County prosecutor's office, which just this week announced the outcome of the last high-profile case of football players' alleged violence in the Sayreville hazing incident. \n \nAlong with the five recently active players, who have all been suspended from the team , the suspects include the daughter of a high school football coach and a brother of one of the players. The suspects also include a former Rutgers University player, \u00a0Tejay Johnson, 23, who was charged on Aug. 5 with armed robbery, criminal restraint and weapons offenses, court records show. It was not the first time the standout defensive back was in legal trouble \u2014 he was accused of beating and robbing a man in Egg Harbor, charges that were later dropped . \n \n\"It's heartbreaking,\" said a college coach in Johnson's hometown of Egg Harbor who followed his career. \"We were just talking about him. Was he going back to Rutgers this year?\" \n \nIn addition to Johnson \u2014 alleged to be involved in every incident and jailed on $650,000 bail \u2014 the other suspects are: \n Andre Boggs, a starting cornerback , who is being held on $500,000 bail, according to the Middlesex County Adult Corrections Center in North Brunswick. He was involved in the Hartwell Street and Livingston College invasions, authorities said. He has been widely regarded as a hero in his native Coatesville, Pa., a small rural town where, as one resident said Thursday, \"everybody knows everybody.\"  Nadir Barnwell, the cornerback whose academic status the head coach allegedly meddled in. He was charged with aggravated assault and riot in the alleged Delafield assault. Thursday evening, he was in the process of being bailed out of jail, records show.  Ruhann Peele, who has just moved past his own legal issues stemming from an assault charge , was jailed on $25,000 bail, according to records. He was also accused in the Delafield assault. \"I hope this doesn't affect his scholarship,\" said Dr. Marlena Berghammer, a neighbor of Peele's mother. \"I hope he doesn't [lose it], he was the one in his family his mother was counting on. His mother works so hard,\" she said, also describing Peele as a \"good boy\" who \"keeps to himself.\"  Rahzonn Gross, a sophomore fullback who allegedly participated in the attack on Delafield Street. Bail was set at $25,000, prosecutors said.  Delon Stephenson, a junior defensive back from Sayreville, also charged in the Delafield attack. Bail was set at $75,000.  Daryl Stephenson, Delon's brother, who prosecutors said Thursday was still at large. Bail was set at $25,000, again in the alleged Delafield attack.  Jianan Chen, 19, of New Brunswick, and Dylan Mastriana, 19, a Rutgers student, allegedly planned several of the home invasions, prosecutors said. Bail was set at $500,000 for Mastriana and $100,000 for Chen. It's unclear where they're being held.  Kaylanna Ricks, charged with driving the getaway car in a home invasion. Bail was set at $75,000, but no information was available from jail records.

But then they made their third elimination-final exit in a row. \n\n2015 season review\n\nTeam: Richmond looked to have made progress in 2015 with impressive wins over the league's elite. But all of that may have been wasted through a third-straight elimination-final exit. What should Tiger supporters take out of the year?\n\nPosition: Fifth (at end of home and away games, 15-7). Lost to North Melbourne in an elimination final.\n\nLast season: Eighth (12-11)\n\nPlayers used: 38\n\nPersonnel changes: It's been a stable era for the Tigers, with coach Damien Hardwick and chief executive Brendon Gale in unison since 2010, and with president Peggy O'Neal \u2013 in her second season in charge after replacing Gary March \u2013 adding her voice to their calls for patience from fans. However, Hardwick has only a year left on his contract, and the Tigers face an intriguing debate this summer over whether to extend his deal in a show of faith or wait until next season and see if an important step is made. We know what the Tigers of old would do. On the field, Taylor Hunt was a success in midfield, playing in 23 matches after joining from Geelong. Kamdyn McIntosh, after a 2014 campaign derailed by injury, would also become a regular.\n\nOut the door: Veteran Chris Newman revealed in August he intended to retire, and the Tigers had hoped to finally deliver a finals win for the veteran defender. But it wasn't to be and, after 268 games and 14 seasons, Newman retired on Sunday without that cherished victory. Chris Knights' wretched run with injury has forced the talented forward into retirement. Ruckman Shaun Hampson is one of a handful of players fighting to retain his spot.\n\nWhat went right: Wins over Fremantle at Domain Stadium, over the Swans at the SCG and Hawthorn at the MCG were impressive. The Tigers were tough in the clinches through the home-and-away campaign, recording a contested-possession differential of +7.9, ranked fourth in the league, but they were -33 against the Kangaroos. Key forward Ty Vickery came of age but he will be haunted over summer by his miss for goal late in the elimination final. Overall, Brett Deledio emerged as a goal-kicking star (except in the elimination final), Jack Riewoldt was unselfish, Alex Rance inked a long-term contract and was superb in defence, Dustin Martin was a force, McIntosh and Hunt added depth and small forward Shane Edwards continued to show his toughness. The team matured in its ability to execute a game plan.\n\nWhat went wrong: A third-straight exit in an elimination final, blowing \u2013 as they did against Carlton in 2013 \u2013 a strong lead. Board expectations were that the Tigers would win at least one final. While there was progress through the season, their campaign may ultimately be remembered for questionable selection decisions last week in recalling the underdone Ben Griffiths (first match since round 17) and Reece Conca (first game since round 19 and only third of the year) for the elimination final, after Ben Lennon and Sam Lloyd had been regular selections at the back end of the season. The Tigers had learnt to be more patient through the season, particularly when counter-attacking from half-back, but their skills against the Kangaroos when the pressure was at its fiercest were sloppy. Ruckman Ivan Maric was a warrior but he struggled against bigger-bodied types such as Todd Goldstein. Skipper Trent Cotchin had a stinker when it counted but could Hardwick have helped him more?\n\nShining lights: Alex Rance, Brett Deledio, Shane Edwards, Dustin Martin, Jack Riewoldt, Brandon Ellis and Troy Chaplin had strong home-and-away seasons. But Chaplin, Edwards, Deledio and Ellis were among those to have had a poor finish.\n\nWhat's required to improve in 2016: The bottom line, as Essendon great and prominent commentator Tim Watson says, is that the Tigers still don't have enough players who can play high-level finals football. They need to find a consistent goal-kicking small forward, with Chris Yarran \u2013 used as a rebounding half-back at Carlton in recent seasons \u2013 firmly on the radar. The Tigers felt they were the frontrunner to secure smooth-moving Giant Adam Treloar, but they are now only an outside chance. They need to find themselves a quality back-up big man for Maric, while it's also time to look for a defender to help Rance. Jake Carlisle anyone? Club great Kevin Bartlett has urged an \"ambitious\" off-season recruiting plan.\n\nWho'd have believed it: Another finals disaster would have resulted in Hardwick's instant sacking in the 1980s and '90s. He will be back for 2016.\n\nGrade: Were expected to win a final.

REUTERS\/Darren Staples  \nLONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - A two-year spell of jobs growth across British factories came to an end last month as manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace, a survey showed, suggesting the sector is unlikely to boost economic growth much this quarter. \n\nThe Markit\/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell in August to 51.5 from 51.9 in July, confounding expectations for a rise to 52.0. \n\nWhile still holding above the 50 threshold for growth, the survey underlined Britain's reliance on its services sector and big-spending consumers to drive the economy. \n\nThere were mixed signals for the manufacturing outlook. New orders came in at the fastest pace in five months but export orders continued to contract, while backlogs of work shrank at the fastest pace since March 2013. \n\nAnd the PMI's jobs index fell below 50 for the first time since April 2013, adding to recent signs Britain's labour market has cooled off after a two-year strong run. \n\n\"The UK manufacturing sector remains in a holding pattern, with production growth hovering around the stagnation mark and marginal job losses reported for the first time in 26 months,\" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit. \n\n\"On this basis, the sector looks unlikely to make much of a contribution to the solid gain in broader GDP growth expected for the third quarter.\" \n\nSurvey compiler Markit said worries about the health of the Chinese economy ought only to have a minimal impact on British manufacturers, given exports to China make up only a small proportion of the British total. \n\nBut it added that it was too early to say if there would be any knock-on effects. \n\nA survey from manufacturing lobby EEF at the weekend suggested almost half of British manufacturers were worried about a possible sharp slowdown in China, with one-in-ten reviewing their business plans. \n\nMarkit said prices paid by manufacturers for raw goods and energy plunged at the fastest pace since January, suggesting little sign of inflation pressure in the pipeline from British industry. \n\nOil prices fell near a 6-1\/2-year low last week, entrenching expectations of low inflation in advanced economies and pushing back market expectations for the first Bank of England interest rate hike from the Bank of England deep into next year. \n\nLast month the BoE stressed how a recent strengthening of the pound and a renewed fall in oil prices would push down inflation until at least the middle of next year, adding that the impact of a recent rise in sterling could persist even longer. \n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by Toby Chopra)","title":"UK factory growth slips, hiring deteriorates in August - PMI","media-type":"News","source":"Yahoo!

MPs have a free vote on the issue, which will break across party lines. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nMr Marris said the current law was a \"mess\" and his Bill was about offering people \"choice and dignity\". \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r \nIn a blog post ahead of the debate, the Wolverhampton South West MP said: \"With appropriate, strong safeguards, terminally ill adults of sound mind should be legally allowed to choose to have assistance to end their own lives. \n\n\"I value life, and I do understand that some people believe very deeply that ending one's own life is always wrong. Nevertheless, the depth and sincerity of their belief should not mean that they deny choice to those of us who do not share their beliefs.\" \n\nUnder the Bill's clauses, two doctors and a High Court judge would have to be satisfied of the requesting patient's eligibility - defined as being terminally ill with less than six months to live, mentally fit to make the decision and aware of alternatives - before the right to die would be allowed. \n\nThe patient must administer the fatal medication themselves under the rules in the Bill. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nMr Marris added: \"At present the law denies dying people the choice of a safe, legal assisted death, whilst turning a blind eye to home suicides, and to technically illegal actions by doctors, and to Dignitas deaths. \n\n\"Last summer the Supreme Court issued Parliament with a final warning, to address the problems - in a democracy it is elected representatives who should make the laws. \n\n\"As an MP, as a lawyer, and as an individual, I am convinced that we can and should allow better choice for dying people.\" \n\nThe Bill is certain to be strongly opposed by MPs on both sides of the Commons, and spark noisy debate outside Parliament's walls. \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nFormer GP and Tory MP Sarah Wollaston said she would not back the legislation because of fears \"the wider harms outweigh the benefits\". \n\nShe said: \"For all the Bill's supposed safeguards, once we cross the line to allow medically assisted dying we risk ending up in a very different place and with very different attitudes to the value of life. \n\n\"Far better in my view for Parliament to focus on the urgent need to improve palliative care.\" \n\nPrime Minister David Cameron is to miss the free vote as he attends regional visits. \n\nA spokesman said: \"The Prime Minister has made his views clear on this issue before. He is not convinced that further steps need to be taken and he is not in favour of an approach that would take us closer to euthanasia.\" \n\r\n\t\t\t\r \nA Commons vote on the right to die has not been held since 1997. \n\nMr Marris' Bill faces a tough road to the statute book though e nough MPs are expected to stay in Westminster for the debate to ensure a second reading vote takes place. \n\nAt least 100 MPs will need to be present to vote for a closure motion to end the debate and force a division before 2.30pm. If a closure motion is not passed, opponents could try and talk the Bill past the deadline effectively dooming its chance of progress. \n\nIf the Bill does win a second reading today, as backbench legislation it can only be considered on a small number of Friday sittings of the Commons but still needs to go through all the normal legislative stages. \n\nThis offers opponents further chances to talk it out of time with many amendments and lengthy speeches at later stages. \n\nA similar Bill, introduced by Lord Falconer, was granted a second reading by the House of Lords following a marathon and impassioned debate last year. \n\nIt was subject to two days of detailed committee stage debate but failed to make progress before the election. \n\n\r\n         Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2015, All Rights Reserved.","title":"MPs to vote on right to die for first time in 20 years in landmark debate","media-type":"News","source":"Crawley Observer","published":"2015-09-11T02:38:41Z"}
{"id":"35631c26-0e3a-472d-ac0a-3faf7a6c346a","content":"Seeds of Alzheimer's disease can potentially attach to surgical instruments and be transferred from one person to another during certain medical procedures, a study suggests. \n \nThe findings provide the first evidence of dementia transmission in humans via microscopic protein fragments. \n \nHealth officials and experts were quick to reassure the public after the highly controversial research was reported in the leading journal Nature. \n \nHowever the findings prompted speculation about the safety of some medical procedures, including dental treatments. Blood donations are not considered a meaningful risk, but should be investigated as a precaution, say the researchers. \n \nBritish scientists stumbled on the discovery while investigating a rare form of \"iatrogenic\" Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (iCJD), a brain-destroying condition known to be spread by contaminated surgical instruments and procedures. \n \nThey inspected the brains of eight patients who died from the disease after receiving pituitary growth hormone extracted from cadavers. \n \nUnexpectedly, six bore a clear molecular hallmark of Alzheimer's - sticky clumps of fragmented protein called amyloid beta that form among neurons and on the walls of blood vessels. In four cases, the amyloid deposits were widespread and only one patient was not affected at all. \n \nAll eight individuals were relatively young, aged 36 to 51, and none had genetic variants associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. \n \nThe evidence points to the hormone carrying \"seeds\" of the Alzheimer's protein into the patients' brains as well as CJD. \n \nSince the prion proteins responsible for iCJD can be transmitted in other ways - for instance, by neurosurgery - experts are not ruling out the possibility that the same is true for the Alzheimer's molecule. \n   Promoted stories   \nLead scientist Professor John Collinge,  director of the Medical Research Council Prion Unit at University College London, said there was increasing evidence that neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's might, in rare circumstances, be \"acquired\". \n \nSpeaking on a phone-link to the British Science Festival taking place at the University of Bradford, he said: \" You could have three different ways you have these protein seeds generated in your brain. Either they happen spontaneously, an unlucky event as you age, or you have got a faulty gene, or you've been exposed to a medical accident. That's what we're hypothesising.\" \n \nHe pointed out that , like CJD prions, amyloid beta protein fragments stick to metal surfaces and resist conventional sterilisation. \n \nPrevious experiments on laboratory mice and monkeys had already shown that transmission of the Alzheimer's protein is theoretically possible. \n \nWhen liquified brain tissue from dead Alzheimer's patients was injected into the central nervous systems of the animals, they developed the brain changes associated with the disease. \n \nThe scientists do not believe CJD prions somehow triggered the development of amyloid beta deposits in the brains of the growth hormone patients. B rains of 116 patients with prion diseases who had not received pituitary growth hormone did not have the Alzheimer's hallmark, and the two diseases affect different brain areas. \n \nOther research has shown th at amyloid beta can form in the pituitary gland, a pea-sized body at the base of the brain. \n \nNone of the patients had developed Alzheimer's symptoms and their brains did not show another key change associated with the disease, twisted strands of protein within nerve cells called tau tangles. Whether or not they would have started to suffer symptoms had they lived longer remains an unanswered question. \n \nQuestioned specifically about dentistry, Prof Collinge said: \"The seeds will potentially stick to metal surfaces whatever the instrument is. With prions, we know quite a lot about that. Certainly, there are potential risks with dentistry where it's impacting on nervous tissue, for example root canal treatment, and special precautions are taken with reamers that are used in root canal treatment for that reason, in the UK at least. \n \n\"If you are speculating that amyloid beta seeds might be transferred by instruments, one would have to consider whether certain types of dental procedure might be relevant.\" \n \nHe stressed there was no epidemiological evidence at all to suggest that Alzheimer's could be transmitted via blood transfusions, but added: \"I think it's not unreasonable to have a look. My concerns would be more to see if there is a risk of seeding from metal surfaces. I think that is something we ought to prioritise.\" \n \nLater he appeared to backtrack on dental treatments, issuing a statement saying the current data had \"no bearing\" on dental surgery and  \"certainly do not argue that dentistry poses a risk of Alzheimer's disease\". \n \nProf Collinge said: \"Our findings relate to the specific circumstance of cadaver-derived human growth hormone injections, a treatment that was discontinued many years ago. It is possible our findings might be relevant to some other medical or surgical procedures, but evaluating what risk, if any, there might be requires much further research.\" \n \nMeanwhile, he urged people not to be concerned about planned medical procedures, and to dismiss any notion of Alzheimer's being \"contagious\" in the same way as flu, for instance. \n \n\"No way is this suggesting that Alzheimer's is a contagious disease,\" he said. \"You can't catch it by living with someone who has Alzheimer's disease or being a carer. \n \n\"I don't want to cause any alarm. No-one should consider cancelling or delaying any kind of surgery. But I think it would be prudent to do some research in this area going forward.\" \n \nThe chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, also stepped in to reassure the public, maintaining there was \"no evidence\" that Alzheimer's disease can be transmitted in humans through any medical procedure. \n \nShe added: \"This was a small study on only eight samples. We monitor research closely and there is a large research programme in place to help us understand and respond to the challenges of Alzheimer's. \n \n\"I can reassure people that the NHS has extremely stringent procedures in place to minimise infection risk from surgical equipment, and patients are very well protected.\" \n \nTreatment of people of short stature with pituitary growth hormone taken from dead donors began in the UK in 1958. It was stopped in 1985 after confirmed reports of CJD among recipients. \n \nBecause growth hormone from different cadavers was mixed up before being distributed, a treatment given to an individual patient may have originated from a large number of donors. This greatly increased the risk of disease transmission. \n \nIn total, 1,848 men and women in the UK underwent the procedure for stunted growth, and of these 77 have so far died from CJD. \n \nAs of 2012, 450 cases of iatrogenic CJD have been identified around the world linked to cadaver-derived growth hormone and to a lesser extent other medical procedures, including corneal transplants and neurosurgery. \n \nThe fear is that Alzheimer's protein seeds could follow similar transmission pathways as CJD prions. \n \nDr Eric Karran, chief scientist at the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \" The biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's is age, along with genetic and lifestyle factors. If further research was to confirm a link between historical tissue contamination and Alzheimer's, it would only likely be relevant to a tiny proportion of the total number of people affected.\" \n \nDr Doug Brown, director of research at Alzheimer's Society, said: \" Injections of growth hormone taken from human brains were stopped in the 1980s. There remains absolutely no evidence that Alzheimer's disease is contagious or can be transmitted from person to person via any current medical procedures.\" \n \nProfessor Nigel Hunt, dean of the faculty of dental surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons, said:  \"This study alone does not provide any conclusive proof that Alzheimer's disease can be transmitted from person to person. Dental practice carries no more risk than any invasive clinical procedure. This is new research in a field of relatively recent scientific enquiry that needs to be taken seriously with further research to inform any changes to all clinical and dental practice. \n \n\"In dentistry, patients are protected from infection risks through the widespread use of single use instruments. All dental instruments that are reused are covered either by guidance from Nice (National Institute of Health and Care Excellence) or guidance about decontamination in primary care dental practices. The findings from today's study must be considered by all relevant organisations to ensure current guidance is as robust as it needs to be.\" \n \nThe British Dental Association's scientific adviser, Professor Damien Walmsley, said:  \"Dentists take patient safety very seriously and follow strict protocols to protect patients from the risk of infections, however slight that risk may be. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"These protocols were strengthened in 2007 when a UK-wide restriction on the re-use of files that come into contact with nervous tissue during root canal treatments was put in place. \n \n\"These measures make dentistry one of the safest areas of healthcare.\"","title":"'Seeds' of Alzheimer's 'might be transferred on medical instruments'","media-type":"News","source":"Hereford Times","published":"2015-09-09T17:08:39Z"}

All their focus is on the US Open. We really haven't been talking about it too much.\" \n \nIn a promising sign, Kyrgios spent last week preparing for the US Open at Hewitt's Bahamas base and noted: \"We've got a really good relationship now, which is going to be unbelievable for Davis Cup. I have really good trust in him.\" \n \nAsked by a British journalist what he made of Australia's prospects for the indoor hardcourt tie in Glasgow from September 18-20, Kyrgios said: \"Pretty good. Pretty good. Yep, really good.\" \n \nTomic, who plays Davis Cup stalwart Lleyton Hewitt in the second round at Flushing Meadows on Thursday, said his camp had spoken with TA and Cup captain Wally Masur and \"we are on the good side\". \n \n\"Am I playing or not playing? I am not sure of the situation now but after the US Open, when I am out, I am happy to talk about that,\" said the Australian No.1. \n \nThe only certainty, if Tomic and Kyrgios are available, is that Masur will have a selection headache. \n \nHewitt, who only played on in 2015 to have one last crack at Davis Cup glory, is a lock, while Sam Groth seems so too following his singles and doubles heroics in Darwin. \n \nFrom 2-0 down against the Kazakhs after first-day singles losses for Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis, Hewitt and Groth teamed to win the doubles before piloting Australia to its first Davis Cup victory from such a deficit since 1939. \n \nPresumably in preparation for the semi-final, Hewitt is partnering Groth at a grand slam for the first time in New York. \n \n\"Sam is growing as a player. He's made massive inroads from the Czech Republic when he played his first live match to Darwin,\" Hewitt said. \n \n\"I think it's really helped him as a player week in and week out. Just that belief, you know, getting over those nerves of going out there and not just playing for yourself. \n \n\"He was great, fantastic.\" \n \nAll things being equal, with Kyrgios being in the right head space and Tomic available, they'd join Hewitt and Groth. \n \nBut that would mean Kokkinakis, a favourite of TA and Hewitt, would miss the four-man team and the 19-year-old was already preparing for his trip to Glasgow after his gallant first-round loss to Wimbledon semi-finalist Richard Gasquet on Tuesday. \n \nIf not for cramps that forced his retirement at two sets all, Kokkinakis might have knocked out the 12th seed. \n \nBut with Murray boasting an ominous 15-0 career head-to-head record over Australian opponents, Kyrgios appears the only player capable of challenging the Scot - when he's on. \n \nMasur has until Tuesday to settle on a line-up and a tennis Nostradamus might say he will go with Hewitt, Groth, Kyrgios and Tomic with Kokkinakis as a rather handy hitting partner.","title":"Davis Cup team shrouded in mystery","media-type":"News","source":"Northern Territory Government","published":"2015-09-03T03:04:11Z"}

The junior was well clear of the field at 2 miles (10:14) and simply cruised the final mile for the win. Carleo was more than seven seconds in front of Molvar (16:29.20) at the finish. Wren finished a solid third with his 16:38.52. \n\n\u201cI made a move at the beginning of the second loop,\u201d Carleo said. \u201cI looked back a couple of times to see if there was anybody coming.\u201d \n\nMichael Weidenbruch finished seventh in 16:50.13 to lead Marblehead to the team title with 68 points, well ahead of Wakefield\u2019s 100 points and Newburyport\u2019s 117. \n\nSophomore Stephanie Casaletto of Austin Prep dueled with Ipswich standout Emily DeMarco at the halfway point before switching gears to break away to a 19:04.18 win in the Div. 2 girls event. Teammate Sarah Oliver clocked 19:12.29 for second and DeMarco claimed the bronze medal with her 19:24.18. \n\nCasaletto took DeMarco\u2019s move very seriously. \n\n\u201cEmily DeMarco is such a good runner, and she passed me,\u201d she said. \u2018I don\u2019t know.

{"id":"2a445d24-64d6-4d53-954d-4be5512574af","content":"I have shocked shopkeepers, family and friends by openly declaring I would not abort if my baby was diagnosed with Down\u2019s. I\u2019m shocked by their shock I am four months pregnant and, while I don\u2019t feel remotely maternal yet, this will be a precious and much loved child. I have reached the point at which it will soon be possible to know the gender and so, wherever I go, people ask: \u201cWill you find out if it\u2019s a girl or a boy?\u201d\n\nLast week a friendly young sales assistant asked me just that as I trawled clothing racks looking for elastic waisted pants. I said \u201cno\u201d and added that I had not had the test for Down\u2019s syndrome either because if I had found that my child was at risk, I would not have wanted to abort. \u201cThat\u2019s the real question,\u201d I said, \u201cthe one that people really should ask about.\u201d\n\nThe poor sweet girl gaped at me lost for words and I stood in silence too, gripped by the uneasy feeling that comes when you make a social faux pas. My friends and family were shocked that I had made this remark \u2013 it turns out that everybody knows about the Down\u2019s syndrome test but it\u2019s something that we collectively, pointedly and deliberately ignore. \n\nAs someone who has spent part of my working life in close intersection with people with disabilities and their families, this has come as a genuine shock.\n\nThe nuchal translucency scan, as it is called, must be undertaken by 13 or 14 weeks. It is a non-invasive screening test which ascertains the likelihood that a foetus will turn out to have Down\u2019s syndrome. For those deemed likely, the next test in the normal course of events is Chorionic Villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentisis, both of which are conducted by placing a needle into the uterus and both of which can diagnose Down\u2019s syndrome for sure. \n\nBoth levels of testing are conducted routinely in the private and public health systems. This testing path, however, brings both questions and risks.\n\nFirst, amniocentisis testing carries a 0.5%\u20131% risk of miscarriage, meaning that some non-Down\u2019s syndrome foetuses are inevitably miscarried as a result of the test itself.\n\nSecond, it is standard practice in Australia that pregnancies are aborted upon finding that women are likely to be carrying a baby with Down\u2019s syndrome, one study estimates the figure to be 95%. \n\nThere are approximately 13,000 people with Down\u2019s syndrome living in Australia today with their life expectancy at birth now reaching 60-plus years. Some of those people continue to live at home and be supported by their families well into adulthood, others move onto disability packages at a significant cost to the public purse. \n\nBeyond the purely economic measures though, there is a bigger and far more important question here \u2013 what value does each individual bring to the life of the world? \n\nThere is no doubt that people with Down\u2019s syndrome, like those with other disabilities, can have lives that are incredibly hard. The disability field is wracked with the dilemma of how to manage the young people exhibiting what are euphemistically called \u201cchallenging behaviours\u201d \u2013 violence and aggression brought about by the frustration of their physical limitations and of their inability to communicate. Beyond that, there is a frightening and hard to manage vulnerability to abuse. \n\nBut on the other side, there\u2019s the inescapable fact that people with disabilities bring great love and joy. There is a challenge to our mainstream values to be found among those who are dancing to an entirely different tune.\n\nIn her memoir about surviving shocking abuse, the American author Yvonne Pierre writes that her children taught her the meaning of unconditional love and that her son with Down\u2019s syndrome is always showing her \u201cthat life is so much bigger than self\u201d.\n\nIt was always my observation as I worked with special schools that for families the experience of having a child with a disability was completely make or break. Many people undoubtedly broke under the strain \u2013 there is good reason why children with disabilities form a high proportion of those in foster care \u2013 but for many others the experience made them who they were. Ordinary people became advocates, they developed a profound sense of what was important. They exuded a compassion I rarely saw elsewhere. \n\nFor that reason, disability issues have had a profound impact on me \u2013 the work is depressing (there is never enough money) but it is also very deep, and inspiring too.\n\nRecently a version of this debate broke out in the US. A bill was presented to the Ohio state legislature proposing to restrict abortion in response to a diagnosis of Down\u2019s syndrome. The primary motivation though was not the place of people with a disability. Its sponsors were people involved in the Right to Life movement.\n\nI understand that continuing with a pregnancy of a likely disabled child is as difficult a decision as most people will ever make. I do not believe it should be regulated \u2013 I am decidedly pro choice \u2013 but that it happens without discussion is shocking to me. I chose to adopt two babies with Down\u2019s syndrome as a single mother So, I am 18 weeks down the line and have missed the moment for the test. I hope very deeply that the child I carry will not have Down\u2019s syndrome, although because I\u2019m over 40, there is a reasonably significant chance that it will. \n\nI hope if that does happen that I will have the capacity to live in accordance with the values I profess \u2013 that I will advocate and be compassionate; that I will live in the love that my special child brings to this world.\n\nThere is no guarantee that that will actually take place. I may mourn the life I would otherwise have lived and feel the same way for my somewhat helpless child.\n\nI do know, though, that whatever is the outcome for us, I\u2019m uncomfortable to find I live in a society that blithely, secretly and routinely makes a different choice. I would like to imagine a society with better values than this \u2013 a community in which we do more than count the cost, be it a cost in dollar terms or in life expectations.\n\nEvery one of us brings something unique to the world \u2013 surely we can see the value of difference as well as of conformity and we can extend our love and care to people with disabilities, both those among us now and those who hold at this stage just the potential for life.","title":"I didn't get the prenatal tests for Down's syndrome.

Michelle Bass and Emma Greenwood. \n Emma Greenwood (left) and Michelle Bass (Yui Mok\/PA) \nThe first-ever fake eviction came during Big Brother 5 when Michelle and Emma were voted into a bedsit. \n \nThey spied on the house and played pranks on their fellow housemates, including turning off the hot water every time Victor Ebuwa took a shower. \n \nHowever, Emma heard Victor slating her and when she confronted him about it, a huge fight kicked off. \n   Promoted stories   \nSecurity guards intervened, the police were called and producers took the show off-air. Emma was moved back to the bedsit and then promptly evicted for real. \n \n2. Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt. \n Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt  (Ian West\/PA) \nSpeidi, as these spouses are collectively known, quickly established themselves as public enemy number one during Celebrity Big Brother 11 thanks to refusals to take part in certain tasks, diva-like threats to call their lawyers and numerous heated confrontations with fellow housemates, especially eventual winner Rylan Clark (at that time, best known for The X Factor). \n \nWhen the Americans were given a secret mission to stage a fake walk-out, the other housemates easily believed they\u2019d finally quit the show. \n \nHowever, Speidi lived in luxury in Big Brother\u2019s pimped-out basement, listening to every bad word said about them by the other stars. Their eventual return to the main house was TV gold. \n \n3. Charley Uchea. \n Charley Uchea (Joel Ryan\/PA) \nSelf-styled, argumentative south London \u201cit-girl\u201d Charley was fake evicted during Big Brother 8 as part of the show\u2019s Fake Week theme. \n \nThe best part of the Londoner\u2019s bogus departure came when she emerged from the house to silence: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on guys? Where\u2019s the cheers, man?\u201d she asked. \n \nCharley\u2019s \u201ceviction interview\u201d by then-presenter Davina McCall was watched by her stunned housemates before she went back into the house. \n \n4. Marc O\u2019Neill. \n Marc O\u2019Neill (Channel 5\/PA) \nAs far as his fellow housemates were concerned, Big Brother 16\u2032s Marc was loud, opinionated and annoying. In other words, he was the perfect fake eviction choice. \n \nMarc joined legendary Big Brother housemates Nikki Grahame, Helen Wood and Brian Bello in the \u201cbunker\u201d, where they all secretly spied on the shenanigans and exerted sole control over nominations. \n \nAfter listening in on private conversations, Harry Amelia Martin was chosen to face the public vote. \n \n5. Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace. \n Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace (Yui Mok\/PA) \nThe most memorable moment of Aisleyne\u2019s fake eviction? She cried enough tears to fill the Thames. This Big Brother 7 star was secretly moved to the House Next Door, with the remaining housemates believing she\u2019d been evicted. \n \nAisleyne was joined by five new housemates and, as part of a task, chose four to join her in the main house. However, the then-glamour model collapsed in tears after facing a final choice of evicting either Jonathan Leonard or Spiral Coroner. \n \nAisleyne saved Spiral, and if you listen closely, you will still hear her crying over her decision to evict Jonathan. \n \n6. Casey Batchelor and Lee Ryan. \n Casey Batchelor and Lee Ryan (Ian West\/PA) \nDuring Celebrity Big Brother 13, the overplayed fake eviction became mesmerising viewing for the first time in ages thanks to Blue singer Lee\u2019s horrid, torrid love triangle. \n \nThe pop star had flirted with 34GG-sized glamour model Casey before transferring his affections to American actress Jasmine Waltz, rubbing his new-found attraction to her in poor Casey\u2019s face. Ouch. \n \nThat was bad enough, but then the dastardly voting public promptly forced Lee and Casey to spend time alone together in an even smaller space. It made for cringe-inducing viewing, but Big Brother fans got what they wanted. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nIf tonight\u2019s fake eviction is anything like these gems, we\u2019re in for a treat.","title":"Celebrity Big Brother 2015: 6 of the best fake evictions ever","media-type":"News","source":"Cardigan and TivySide Advertiser","published":"2015-09-11T15:57:20Z"}

It shows the fantastic scale and fantastic interest and we will have a brilliant attendance. \n\r \n\u201cThere are still tickets available, in fact 40,000 are still available.\u00a0 Another great success has been our ticket reselling platform. We\u2019ve had 55,000 sold in a safe and secure way, which is a great success and first for this tournament.\u201d \n\r \nMeanwhile, World Rugby president Bernard Lapasset dismissed the notion that the next edition in 2019 could be moved because of concerns over the scrapping of Tokyo\u2019s planned stadium. \n\r \nThe high-cost venue was to be the centrepiece of the first ever Rugby World Cup in Asia in four years\u2019 time and would also play a part in the Olympics in 2020. \n\r \nBut plans for the stadium were scrapped earlier this year due to the rising costs (believed to be around $2bn). Lapasset, however, insisted the tournament would go ahead as planned. \n\r \n\"We have no Plan B for 2019,\u201d he said. \"We are very confident of working with Japan.

{"id":"a3ab3e80-2a05-4256-aa44-3a6ba8e3f66a","content":"Dear Volkswagen: \n\nI want my money back. \n \nTwo years ago, when I went shopping for a new car for the first time in 10 years, I ended up buying one of yours: A 2014 Passat TDI. \n\nPart of your Clean Diesel lineup, the sales manager told me, it was a car that would allow me to be environmentally responsible while enjoying superior fuel economy. \n \nI actually thought she was serious. \n\nNow I know better. \n\nTurns out the impressive emissions numbers you touted in your ads and showrooms were fraudulent. It wasn't innovative engineering that made those numbers possible, but some software sleight-of-hand that allowed your clean diesel engines to enable emissions controls when government regulators were watching and turn them off during ordinary driving. \n\nI'm not an engineer, but I recognize the technology you employed to disguise your cars' exhaust fumes as a variation on the tactic parolees use to conceal drug use from their parole officers. \n\nA few years ago, I wrote about a product called the Whizzinator, which was designed, like Volkswagen's emissions software, primarily to deceive government regulators. \n\nAvailable in a variety of flesh tones designed to accommodate every (male) customer, the Whizzinator used a plastic penis to deliver untainted urine from a concealed reservoir to a specimen cup under the scrutiny of vigilant parole officers, bypassing the test subject's own organs and any incriminating waste products they might house. \n\nSubstitute some sophisticated software code for the Whizzinator's crude plumbing and you have the tactic Volkswagen used to deceive EPA officials testing the automakers' vehicles for illegal levels of air pollution. \n\nWhen the EPA called foul on your company last week, I hesitated to believe its allegations. After all, it was my own judgment the agency was implicating as well as yours. \n\nAs a journalist, I take some pride in my capacity to discern when someone is misleading me, whether unwittingly or deliberately. So I waited all weekend for your official response, hoping Volkswagen would provide evidence that the EPA was mistaken or, at the very least, that the company, too, had been deceived by a handful of renegade employees. \n\nBut when CEO Martin Winterkorn finally broke his silence Sunday, he offered no extenuating circumstances that might mitigate the company's culpability for the clean diesel hoax. \n\n\u201cI personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public,\u201d Winterkorn, who resigned Wednesday, said in a statement. \n\nLike most apologies for cheating, your CEO's would have been more impressive if he'd made it before he was caught with his pants down.\u00a0 \n\nThe bottom line, then, is that you lied to me and everyone else who purchased one of your clean diesel vehicles. I then amplified your deception, however unwittingly, by boasting that my new vehicle was not only more fuel-efficient than most of neighbors' but cleaner as well. \n\nAnd for that, you owe me more than a belated admission of guilt. \n\nI don't know if I'll ever receive a penny of compensation for that deception, or its negative impact on the resale value of my now 20-month-old fraud-mobile. \n\nBut I know I've purchased my last Volkswagen vehicle. \n\nWhizz me once, shame on you; Whizz me twice, shame on me. \n\nTribune Content Agency \n\nBrian Dickerson is a columnist for the Detroit Free Press.\u00a0","title":"Volkswagen's Whizzinator moment","media-type":"News","source":"Chicago Tribune","published":"2015-09-24T19:15:00Z"}

{"id":"8f2ee074-947c-4634-975a-ea259cc64b21","content":"They are graduating from NSW law schools in numbers greater than their male counterparts, but women still make up just over 20 per cent of barristers, spend fewer hours in court and get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars less in fees. They are graduating from NSW law schools in numbers greater than their male counterparts, but women still make up just over 20 per cent of barristers, spend fewer hours in court and get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars less in fees. Now the NSW Bar Association is proposing national targets and reporting requirements to tackle \"head-on\" the lack of gender diversity at the bar and create a level playing-field for men and women.\n\nA working party commissioned by the association's president, Jane Needham SC, has recommended new targets for briefing women barristers that would apply to law firms with at least 25 lawyers and all government agencies.\n\nIn a report released this week, the working group says that by July 1, 2017, the firms and agencies should give 10 per cent of all briefs to women silks. The target rises to 20 per cent of all briefs given to junior counsel with at least five years' experience, and 35 per cent of briefs given to less experienced juniors. Source: NSW Bar Association survey, 2014 Design: Michael Howard Silks, meanwhile, should try to ensure women appear as their juniors in 23 per cent of matters requiring a court appearance.\n\n\"It's not really asking all that much of people, even though it looks quite radical on its face,\" Ms Needham. \"The figures are very clear that women are not being given the same opportunities as men.\"\n\nMs Needham said the targets had to be \"fairly low\" because women currently make up just under 10 per cent of silks at the NSW bar and 23 per cent of juniors, or 21 per cent of barristers overall. This is despite the fact they now make up more than 66 per cent of law graduates.\n\nThe working group, led by Sydney silks Arthur Moses and Kate Eastman, said the disparity between the fees earned by male and female barristers would be \"unacceptable in any other industry\". Source: Beyond the Statistical Gap: 2009 Court Appearance Survey, Law Council of Australia Design: Michael Howard The average gross annual fees for men at the NSW bar are $437,450 compared with $269,958 for women, a disparity of 38 per cent.\n\nBased on available figures, this appears to be among the biggest pay gaps in the country. The federal Workplace Gender Equality Agency reported in August that the financial and insurance services industry had the biggest gender pay gap at 30.5 per cent but it did not report specifically on barristers' pay.\n\nThe Bar Association's working group noted the pay figures must be read in context, given men were generally older and had been established at the NSW bar longer than women.\n\nA 2009 report by the Law Council of Australia found only 5.8 per cent of appearances by silks in the Federal Court were by women. The average length of the hearing for women silks in that court was just 2.7 hours, compared with 119.7 hours for men.\n\nIf adopted in NSW and around the country, the changes would update the Law Council's equitable briefing policy. Firms and agencies would report annually on the number of men and women barristers briefed.\n\nMr Moses said the existing policy had \"failed and needs to be revisited\" and the disparity in pay between men and women at the bar \"cannot be explained away\". Equitable Briefing Working Group report, 2015 Design: Michael Howard \"The simple fact is that the majority of law graduates for a substantial period of time have been women - indeed, women have been overwhelmingly the best and brightest of the graduates,\" Mr Moses said. \"In order for the bar to remain strong and independent it needs not only to recruit but retain more women.\"\n\nThe Law Council's president-elect, Clayton Utz partner Stuart Clark, said a national briefing policy was required because many law firms briefing barristers operated across at least two jurisdictions. The NSW Bar Association was charged with revising the policy.\n\n\"What we've said, importantly, is things that don't get measured don't get done, so it's absolutely critical that you have sensible targets,\" Mr Clark said. \"There's absolute agreement that the time for talking is over and now is the time for action.\"\n\nThe recommendations will be discussed at a meeting of all associations and the Law Council in the coming months. If NSW is any guide, the proposal is likely to encounter some resistance.

And Dell Curry played a round of golf on Aug. 14 in a foursome that also included Steph, former NBA star Ray Allen and President Obama. \n\nCurry will return as a Hornets broadcaster again for his seventh season and said he is impressed that the Hornets have improved their perimeter shooting (which was always Curry\"\u2122s specialty in his playing days and is now the best part of his sons\"\u2122 games as well). I caught up with Curry this week by phone while he was in Utah on a hunting trip. \n\nQ: Is life any different for you now that Steph has won both an MVP and an NBA title? \n\nA: Well, a little. It\"\u2122s been a whirlwind summer, for sure. I\"\u2122m recognized a little more. \n\r\n\r \r\n\r \r\n\t\r \nAs my daughter said way back when Steph was at Davidson, he put me back on the map. After the Hornets\"\u2122 season ended, I was pretty much able to stay out in Oakland and go to all the playoff games and ride that wave with him and the family. \n\nQ: You will have two sons in the NBA this year, with Seth signing a two-year guaranteed deal to play for Sacramento. He had interest from several teams after starring in the D-league and the NBA\"\u2122s summer league, including Golden State. So why not go play beside his brother? \n\nA: I\"\u2122m really excited for Seth and proud of the way he has worked. He wants to create his own path in his own city, and I respect and understand that. Seth has an opportunity now. I know he can do it. He knows he can do it. But he still has to do it. \n\nQ: So how was playing golf with President Obama? \n\nA: That was one for the bucket list, for sure, to play golf with the most powerful man in the free world. Steph and I played against President Obama and Ray Allen. We lost on the 18th hole and lost a few bucks. The president is a good golfer. He plays from the left side and has a good short game. \n\nQ: You are a respected NBA analyst, and you are Steph\"\u2122s dad.

{"id":"5dd91baf-1220-4d3a-90dc-b80e9058fe90","content":"Q: Our first, a girl, just turned three and has suddenly started throwing tantrums. She can begin a tantrum when she's alone in her room if something she's playing with doesn't do what she wants it to do. It's as if she is right on the edge of a tantrum all day long. We've started walking on eggshells around her as a result, and we realize we're giving in a lot just to keep the peace. We don't understand how such a happy baby and toddler has become such a malcontent. Nothing has changed in our family situation that might explain it. Can you? \n\nA: You're doing what all too many of today's parents tend to do: Instead of trying to solve a behavior problem, you're trying to figure out what has caused it. It's what I call \"thinking psychologically.\" And because none of your theories concerning your daughter's tantrums can be either proven or disproven, you're becoming increasingly confused. The inevitable end result of this is a state I refer to as \"disciplinary paralysis.\" As you confess, you don't know what to do, you're walking on eggshells, giving in to keep the peace. \n\nYou're obviously an intelligent person. I shouldn't need to tell you that every time you shut down a tantrum by giving in, you make the problem that much worse. Short-term \"solutions\" make for long-term nightmares. \n\nSome children begin throwing tantrums when they're 12 months old; some don't start until they're three; but almost all children go through a phase during which they throw lots of tantrums. Why? Because they believe that what they want, they deserve to have. The \"hump\" of parenting is that of patiently, lovingly, but very firmly and steadfastly teaching a child that reality is not going to cooperate with that narcissistic fantasy. Parents who fail to get over that hump are in for a long haul down a hard road. And a child whose parents fail to get over that hump is in for a very rude awakening if not a very unhappy life. \n\nThe very simple solution to your daughter's fits is known as the \"tantrum place.\" First field-tested on my daughter Amy when she began throwing fits of pique at age three, it has since provided much-appreciated relief to many a parent. \n\nTell your daughter that her temper tantrums are very special things and need a very special place. With Amy, we used a half-bathroom, but any relatively isolated place will do, even a rug. \n\nSay, \"The new rule is that when you begin having a tantrum, you have to go to your new tantrum place. If you need help getting there, we will help you. You can scream as long and as loud as you want, but you can't come out until you stop.\" \n\nAt first, she is probably going to come out of her tantrum place before her fit has completely run its course. In that event, just calmly put her back, reminding her of the new rule. \n\nThe important thing is that you act resolutely so as to send the clear message that her outbursts are not going to determine how the world works.

{"id":"9d486048-bcc2-488c-be8a-32d7913c3b3b","content":"You can learn a lot by eavesdropping on the train. I\u2019ve stumbled onto ideas for columns, broadened my understanding of diversity, economics and myriad other topics, not to mention made new friends. \n \nRecently, a couple of those new friends \u2014 a husband and wife counseling team \u2014 were discussing the husband\u2019s plan for an upcoming men\u2019s church retreat. He was complaining mildly that participants\u2019 desire to relax wasn\u2019t right. He felt they should do something more useful with the time by planning an enrichment event for young men in the church, for example. But if rest and relaxation were paramount, they should at least choose a black-owned venue. \n \nHe\u2019d even found one \u2014 one that his cohorts weren\u2019t pleased with because the price for the bed and breakfast was $50 more per night than the next comparable option that was not black-owned. \n \nWhy is that so important, I asked? I knew the likely answer, but my news nose was tingling. \n \nHe went on to talk about the need for economic parity and promoting economic growth among black people, which he felt is just as if not even more important than building up a church community. He and his wife peppered our discussion with historical references: The black community was stronger in the 1920s and \u201930s when it was segregated and we were forced to rely on black businesses to survive; in the 1960s and \u201970s, black people had vision. They understood the bigger picture and why it was critical to \u201cbuy black\u201d lest those valuable dollars continue to flee our community, leaving behind substandard goods and services at markedly higher prices. \n \nThat\u2019s all well and good, but there\u2019s a reason why I don\u2019t buy black. I\u2019m willing to pay a higher price to support the community, but what I don\u2019t support, I told my new train friend, is bad service, shoddy retail space and poor product selections. \n \nTo defend my decisions, I described a vivid and repetitive scene featuring apathetic store clerks and me, walking in ready to plunk down my hard-earned dollars for whatever was suitable, and being stared at as if to say, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d My new acquaintance agreed, but then he began to talk about awareness. \n \nThose clerks, he said, were operating from a deficit. They did not know how to behave toward customers. \u201cThe clerk doesn\u2019t know he or she should speak to me and look engaged when I come into the store?\u201d I asked skeptically. That\u2019s Business Operations 101. \n \nHe nodded solemnly. Those clerks and the business owners who employ them likely have not been groomed to engage customers correctly. The breakdown, he said, between vision and community created a vast knowledge gap that is slowly but surely crippling black business. \n \nI considered this in light of what I know about the power of mentorship and sponsorship, the need to reach back and pull forward those who may not have had the same start, but still need to compete on the same field. Then I considered my new friend\u2019s words in light of what I\u2019ve learned about supplier diversity. This year, we made the decision to feature at least one story on the topic in every issue. If my new train friend\u2019s conversation was any indication, we were more on target than I realized. \n \nBlack communities are woefully short on black-owned businesses. This relates to the economic health and growth of our particular demographic. If consumers like me don\u2019t buy black because of bad service, and bad service is related to lack of awareness, knowledge and skills, it\u2019s more important than ever that corporate supplier diversity programs offer minority business owners the training they may need to compete effectively, expand their businesses and contribute to the economic health of the community. \n \nCheck out our feature \u201cIn Short Supply\u201d to learn more about what companies like Kroger and Walgreens are doing to ensure their supplier diversity programs work. And be sure to let me know what practices you\u2019ve observed at work or believe should be a part of supplier diversity programs. It\u2019s worth examining closely. Companies, communities and families may depend on it.","title":"Editor's Letter: Coming Back to \u2018Buy Black\u2019","media-type":"News","source":"Talent Management","published":"2015-09-21T18:09:37Z"}

{"id":"0074179e-cac1-409c-8dbc-598877434181","content":"Back in the day, Jeff Renz helped pour cement for the M on Mount Sentinel. \n\nMore recently, the law professor had students argue before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \n\nRenz, a longtime professor at the Alexander Blewett III School of Law at the University of Montana, came to Missoula in 1967. He studied forestry, got a degree in botany, and eventually received a law degree from UM. \n\nAfter 14 years in private practice, including several working on high-profile environmental cases for a firm based in Chicago, Renz returned to the law school at UM to teach. He's been on an annual contract since 1993. \n\nAt the end of this semester, the teacher and director of the criminal defense clinic will retire. His departure is linked to the budget crunch at UM, and he appears to be the only contracted professor whose annual employment isn't being renewed because of money. \n\nIn a letter to colleagues this summer, Renz announced his departure. \n\n\"The university's notice comes as a great disappointment to me for many reasons,\" Renz wrote. \"Many of you were my former students. Many of my former students became prosecutors and now sit as judges. \n\n\"I have always found joy in my students' growth from unsure to confident, from arrogant to humble (most of the time), and from ignorance to enlightenment. I will miss that.\" \n\n*** \n\nThe cut at the law school comes despite the fact it is on solid financial footing and steady enrollment, Renz said. \n\n\"The law school has never had budget issues. We've always sent money to Main Hall, and still have been doing that,\" he said. \n\nEnrollment at the law school also has not dropped, he said. In fact, he said, as other law schools across the country saw significant drops in the quality of applicants, such as lower GPA and LSAT scores, the rankings ticked up at UM. \n\nHe said the law school in Missoula was recently one of just four that counted an increase in the number of applicants. \n\nBut the overall enrollment numbers at UM have been in decline. \n\n\"So when that happens, the university calls back money from units,\" Renz said. \"And we'd been doing our fair share from year to year, and this past year, the provost called back a little bit more, and it was a little bit more than the school could bear without making cuts in the program.\" \n\nIn his letter to colleagues, he offered a stark description of the effects of the four-year dip: \"The university cut fat, then more fat, then meat, and now we are down to the bone. I am not the first full-time faculty member to be rif'd (reduction in force), but I am the first full-time member of the law faculty upon whom the ax has fallen.\" \n\n*** \n\nDean Paul Kirgis, who came on board this summer, agreed the law school was doing well financially. \n\nHe said it continues to receive a steady stream of applications in contrast to the roughly 45 percent drop in law school applicants around the country. \n\nHowever, Kirgis said the overall financial picture at UM affects the law school. He said he wasn't part of the negotiation with Renz, but said the agreement came about because of the university-wide need for budget restraint. \n\n\"We are not facing an ongoing budget crisis in the law school, and we have no expectation that we will ... going forward,\" Kirgis said. \n\nHe said the law school did not make other personnel cuts as a result of the budget crunch. \n\n*** \n\nLast semester, the school received a $10 million naming gift from the Blewett family of Great Falls. However, Renz said in his letter the money that could fund his position wouldn't be available for several years. \n\n\"It's sort of ironic, but it's understandable,\" Renz said. \n\nHe also said that his position as a contracted professor made him vulnerable, although he himself had recommended his job be designed that way years ago. \n\n\"In terms of budget, I was always low-hanging fruit,\" Renz said. \n\nHis end date will be Feb. 29. He said the school didn't give him adequate notice of one semester, so he and the former interim dean worked out a deal. \n \nThe agreement gives Renz the upcoming semester to work on his own research, which he will do in Berkeley, California, where his wife will be for a Fulbright award. In exchange, he said, UM avoids paying some three or four months of salary. \n\n\"It was a good compromise,\" Renz said. \n\nHe had planned to retire after this school year or next, regardless: \"So it was not an emotional hit for me.\" \n\n*** \n\nElaine Gagliardi, associate dean of students and professor at the law school, has worked with Renz for roughly 20 years. \n\n\"I have great respect for professor Renz, and I've seen him add a lot to our program,\" Gagliardi said. \"And he has always had very interesting clinic projects that I know have made a difference in a lot of people's lives.\" \n\nAs part of the criminal defense clinic, \"a live client program,\" Renz guided students as they represented their first defendants. The law school clinic offers the future lawyers real-world experience. \n\n\"This is your client. You will learn to swim,\" Renz said of his approach. \"I will be there helping you. Last year, I had students try four cases to a verdict, and they won three of them.\" \n\nEvery year, his students argue in the Ninth Circuit, \"and they do great. It's phenomenal for the experience. Just for having done it.\" \n\nIn fact, he said, the students are the highlight of the years he spent at the law school. It was satisfying to see them grow and excel, he said, and rewarding to see them become seasoned professionals. \n\nThe parting was sometimes painful, though. \n\n\"About every three years, I get a class where I literally grieve when they graduate,\" Renz said. \n\nThe professor has had other career successes beyond campus. A couple years ago, he was the recipient of a Fulbright, which took him to the country of Georgia. \n\nHe also worked with former School of Journalism professor Clem Work on seeking posthumous pardons for people convicted of sedition. Gov. Brian Schweitzer signed the proclamation of pardons in Helena in 2006, with many families of those convicted in attendance. \n\n\"That was very satisfying. We persuaded the governor to pardon all these people from World War I,\" Renz said.","title":"Longtime UM law professor forced to retire early because of budget cuts","media-type":"News","source":"Missoulian","published":"2015-09-07T00:00:00Z"}

It was pre-meditated over a long period of time.\" \n \nMary Shipstone, also known as Maryam Alromisse, was gunned down as she stood next to her mother, clutching a new violin, after she returned from school on September 11 last year, Hastings Coroner's Court was told. \n \nHer father, Yasser Alromisse, 46, was hidden in the rear of a silver Toyota on the drive by the house, in Northiam, near Rye, East Sussex, when he fired the shots. \n \nThe attack took place at Spring Hill, where Mary had lived with her mother Lyndsey Shipstone, for the past year.  She did not want be traced by Alromisse after the collapse of their marriage, which she said had been abusive. \n \nAlromisse had hired the vehicle that morning in Worthing, insisting to rental staff that he needed one with tinted windows, and had created a blind from bin bags to shield himself, the hearing was told. \n \nHis body was later found in a pool of blood in the rear of the car, where he had shot himself in the head. \n \nMr Craze concluded that Mary had been unlawfully killed, and ruled her father's death as suicide. \n \nThe court heard how Alromisse had hired private detective Paul Parton, purporting to be a friend of his ex-wife, in May 2014 to try and establish the location of Mrs Shipstone, who he was still legally married to. \n \nMr Parton was unable to locate Mrs Shipstone and later withdrew his services concerned Alromisse's motive was to take away the child. \n   Promoted stories   \nCoroner Mr Craze said it was not clear how Alromisse eventually found the address, but described the murder as a \"thoroughly despicable act of violence\". \n \nHe added: \"It was not in any way spontaneous. It was pre-meditated over a long period of time.\" \n \nDescribing the day of the shooting, Mrs Shipstone said it had been \"ordinary\", but that Mary was \"very happy\" and \"excited\" about her birthday in seven days' time. \n \nShe had been driven by a neighbour to collect Mary from school where she had had her first violin lesson. They parked up at their neighbour's and walked back towards their house. \n \nMrs Shipstone told the court: \"I was putting my key in the door, and I spoke to Mary, saying she'd like what I had done to her room, and that's the last thing I said to her.\" \n \nMary was stood slightly behind her when she heard a loud noise. \n \nShe said: \"There was a terrific sound behind me like someone had burst a balloon. \n \n\"I turned around and the first thing I saw was Mary on the ground - her legs were crumpled behind her.\" \n \nShe said she quickly realised that her ex-partner had shot Mary, saying she could \"see his face\" in the back seat of the Toyota parked on the nearby drive. \n \nShe told the inquest: \"He did not show any emotion.\" \n \nMrs Shipstone carried Mary to a neighbour's home, where they tried to revive her while waiting for emergency services to arrive.  She was taken to King's College Hospital, London, but later died of her injuries. \n \nAsked why Alromisse would have wanted to kill Mary, Mrs Shipstone replied: \"I don't think I will ever really know that. \n \n\"It was such an extreme thing to do. I can only guess that he wanted to kill himself and for some reason he thought that she should not live without him.\" \n \nShe added: \"He had the opportunity to shoot me as well, but he chose not to do it, and I was the one he supposedly hated the most. \n \n\"It's an act of revenge really. It's got to be. If he really loved her he would never have inflicted that on her.\" \n \nMrs Shipstone told the court: \"He's left me bereft of a daughter\". \n \nMr Craze described it as a \"very sad and tragic case\". \n \nSpeaking to Mrs Shipstone after reaching his conclusion, he said: \"You will, I hope, be relieved that the whole process of the coroner's inquest is over with. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"You have got through it and I hope that the process will be deemed useful to you. \n \n\"But the main thing is you can put a full stop at the end of this chapter and get on with your life.\"","title":"Estranged father gunned down girl, 7, at 'safe house'","media-type":"News","source":"York Press","published":"2015-09-04T19:24:48Z"}

{"id":"3d020363-e4f2-4833-a277-1e02361f7b8a","content":"JERUSALEM, Sept 21 (NNN-XINHUA) - Israel has deployed two anti-missile batteries near the south, after rocket fire from the Gaza Strip over the weekend, fearing a security escalation, Israeli media reported. \n\nThe two Iron Dome anti-missile batteries were deployed near the southern towns of Sderot and Netivot, following last week's rocket barrages to shield against more possible rockets, the Walla! news website reported. \n\nOn Friday evening, several rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip enclave, towards the southern town of Sderot and the coastal town of Ashkelon. One rocket exploded near a house in Sderot and damaged a vehicle, but no injuries were reported. \n\nIn response, Israel air-raided several targets in the Gaza Strip before dawn on Saturday. Palestinian media outlets reported no injuries in the attack. \n\nLast week Israel deployed an anti-missile battery near the town of Ashdod, 32 km south of Tel Aviv and 30 km north of the Gaza Strip. The move was made a day after the Israeli authorities arrested Mohammad Allan, a high-profile Palestinian prisoner who went on a two-month hunger strike. \n\nAllan started the hunger strike in June to protest his administrative detention, a security-related incarceration without trial that can be extended every six month. \n\nIsrael's Supreme Court ordered his release after he was on the brink of death, which triggered violent protests outside his hospital. \n\nHe was released last week, but the Israeli police arrested him shortly after and placed him once again under administrative detention. \n\nMore than 5,000 Palestinian prisoners are now in Israeli jails, many in administrative detention. They are seen as freedom fighters by those who have been living under Israeli occupation since the 1967 Mideast War. \n\nThe rocket attacks are also believed to be connected to the escalating security situation in Jerusalem, specifically surrounding the flashpoint site of Temple Mount\/Al-Aqsa Mosque, east of the city. \n\nThe site is holy to both Jews and Muslims. According to the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan in 1994, Jews are allowed to visit, but not allowed to pray at the site. \n\nIntense clashes broke out last week between Palestinian protesters and Israeli security services, following the visit by an Israeli minister and other right-wing activists to the temple, and after Israeli Defence Minister, Moshe Ya'alon, outlawed two Muslim groups from Jerusalem. \n\nDozens of Israeli policemen and Palestinian protesters were lightly injured and over 30 Palestinians arrested between Sunday and Tuesday last week. \n\nPalestinians charged that Israel is trying to take over the site, which have roused waves of outrage throughout Muslim countries worldwide. \n\nIsraeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, last week that, Israel is planning to keep the status quo at the site. \n\nIsrael blamed the \"Palestinian incitement\" for the growing violence in the city, announcing harsher measures to fight Palestinian rock throwers, including allowing police in Jerusalem to use live sniper fire to disperse riots, harshening sentences for convicted stone throwers and fining the parents of stone-throwing youths.-- NNN-XINHUA","title":"ISRAEL DEPLOYS ANTI-MISSILE AMID FEARS OF ESCALATING VIOLENCE","media-type":"News","source":"NAM News Network","published":"2015-09-21T01:18:07Z"}

{"id":"c49f933f-8176-4184-b81f-1b109f08f527","content":"For those\u00a0outside the inner sanctum of the racing industry who\u00a0are perplexed at the mileage the Peter Moody saga has gained this week or, for that matter,\u00a0the past few months, the answer is simple: an unrelenting media cheer squad. \n\nEven those removed from the sport can see by his poor-taste rants that Moody is slowly unravelling. Whichever way he manoeuvres the question remains:\u00a0how did Lidari\u00a0arrive at\u00a0Flemington with double the threshold levels of cobalt\u00a0in its system? \n\nBut the media cheer squad continue to skirt around\u00a0the clear realities of the case. \n\nFor the\u00a0third time this week, Moody\u00a0threatened to resign from racing. He's threatened to move to Darwin, talked about a pub in Queensland and, for\u00a0all we know, by Saturday\u00a0night he may be looking at a convenience store in Papua New Guinea. \n\nHe has 110 of some of the most expensive racehorses in Australia housed at his Caulfield base.\u00a0His winning strike-rate has not altered, nor has\u00a0his client base\u00a0deserted him since Lidari's swab earlier this year. \n\nBut his trusting media contingency was shown at their very best this week, as they gave Moody more oxygen to explain why the world is against him. \n\nYou see, it's a one-way deal. Moody is a man not to\u00a0fall out with, so the premiership-winning trainer has polarised the media. \n\nThe height of the pro-Moody campaign was achieved by a News Limited reporter \u2014 who had been barred off and on from the Moody stable over the past decade \u2014\u00a0who\u00a0even checked out how the trainer was faring the night of his now-infamous\u00a0race-day treatment at Pakenham. \n\nThe reporter went on to say Moody had arrived home to find the family gone out for the night and he had to manage on scraps and a few beers and their\u00a0faithful\u00a0dog for company. \n\nHowever, worse was to come.\u00a0On Memsie Stakes day at Caulfield, at the start of the meeting, former AFL clerk and racing tipster Shane Anderson mournfully announced after Moody had won the opening race that the trainer would not speak to the media for the remainder of the day as he was under pressure over the cobalt matter. \n\nThis message went out to the newly-launched Channel 78 viewers plus\u00a0 racing.com . \n\nAnderson, the day before Memsie Stakes day, had given Moody 20 minutes of air time to tell his sad-and-sorry story. The only challenging question from Anderson was: \"Do you mind if we go for a commercial break?\" \n\nDuring this interview Moody challenged the industry to \"pull the splinters out of your arse and join me or not\". \n\nWhile Anderson conveyed the news the cobalt issue had prevented Moody\u00a0speaking to the media, 20 metres from where Anderson was working, stewards were grilling Moody over the outrageous statements made on Anderson's show and told the trainer of Black Caviar that such outbursts would\u00a0not be tolerated. They went on to remind Moody of his obligations to the licence that he holds. \n\nThis was not broadcast on Channel 78 nor reported on\u00a0 racing.com . It took Fairfax Media's Andrew Garvey to question whether Moody's media ban\u00a0was connected with stewards. \n\nHe was told Moody was spoken to about his remarks made on Anderson's show. \n\nWhen Fairfax Media tried to contact Channel 78 chief executive Scott Perrin to see if any action had been taken against Anderson, the CEO did not answer our calls. \n\nAnderson last Wednesday gave Moody another 20 minutes of air time to bag officials and continue to cry foul. \n\nThe level of questioning by Anderson was shameful. \"We go back a long way,\u00a0Pete\"\u00a0is not good enough for balanced news. \n\nIt's interesting to note that two weeks last Wednesday Ballarat trainer Kylie Vella was charged under the same race-day-treatment rule\u00a0for using the same poultice\u00a0as Moody's filly. \n\nVella was not given a paragraph in racing publications nor air play on Anderson's show. \n\nAnd it's strange how integrity officers Australia-wide were sacked over the live-baiting scandal that rocked greyhound racing \u2014 with governments and media claiming those in charge had fallen\u00a0asleep at the wheel \u2014\u00a0but once three leading trainers are netted, the rule book must be changed. \n\nA mindless collection of quotes from Moody's friends in the Caulfield trainers' hut that came out in support of him is nowhere near reflective of the feeling of trainers. \n\nFairfax Media has received countless emails from around the state applauding the integrity department of Racing Victoria, as they are sick of being beaten by cheats. \n\nAnd it would be timely to allow Moody, Mark Kavanagh, Danny O'Brien, and Lee and Shannon Hope to have their cases heard without cheer squads and self-styled\u00a0experts who have a year-nine biology background. \n\nIt's worth noting that Lee and Shannon Hope have\u00a0shown class and dignity after they were charged last year. \n\nThe didn't ask for any media free kicks or inside runs. They are sitting and waiting,\u00a0aware that talking and yelling won't help their\u00a0cause. It's timely advice for a few others waiting for their\u00a0day in court to arrive. \n\nThe story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald .","title":"Cobalt: Is Peter Moody on the brink of unravelling?","media-type":"News","source":"Border Watch","published":"2015-09-18T09:26:23Z"}

South Temecula has many things, but corner hangouts for after a sports game, a beer softball league, or a place for teams to host their latest fundraiser are in short supply. \n \nEnter Suzette Swanger, mother and Temecula resident, who saw a restaurant in crisis and stepped in to take it to the next level. \n \n\u201cWe purchased Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs over five months ago,\u201d Swanger said, \u201cand it\u2019s been a heck of a ride since.\u201d \n \n Lagunitas IPA on tap at Temecula\u2019s Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs \u2013 the hot dog joint around the corner. Ashley Ludwig photo.   \nThis hot dog shop has changed hands a few times, but Swanger has that special something to make sure that all who enter to try Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs will return again, with friends and family in tow. \n \nInside, it\u2019s like being invited to a family barbecue \u2013 complete with checked table cloths, mountains of napkins for the juicy dogs and sandwiches and ample supplies of squeezable mustard and ketchup. A jukebox on the wall plays fun, classic or recent hip tunes, depending on the crowd. Regulars hang out at the bar. Families at the tables, ordering hand dipped sweet corn dogs or baskets of homemade potato chips. \n \nRemember, when you come in to Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs, bring the family and prepare to mind your manners during the big game. \n \n\u201cWe initiated a \u2018Bad Word Box\u2019 for anyone caught swearing at the bar when kids are present,\u201d Swanger said, thumbing through the stack of bills. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively new idea and fun for those in the know. At the end of the month we plan on donating the funds raised to a local charity.\u201d \n \nBehind the bar, tap handles range from backyard barbecue cheap beer \u2013 Pabst Blue Ribbon \u2013 that will more than likely always remain on tap, according to Swanger, to featured craft brew, such as the Petaluma based brewer Lagunitas IPA. Regionally famous for their India Pale Ale, this well balanced beer is now featured at Devil Dogs. With caramel malt barley to mellow the hop flavors, Lagunitas is one for beer lovers to try. \n \n\u201cI love having friends over, cooking and entertaining. Devil Dogs has become a natural extension of that,\u201d she said. \n \n Suzette Swanger, right, and staff mug for the camera while the games play on one of many TVs in this local sports bar and restaurant. Ashley Ludwig photo.   \nLunch time at this hot dog shop finds locals at the many tables or hanging out at the comfortable bar seating. TVs have multiple games on, showcasing college football on a September morning. The menu is chock full of gourmet hot dogs, such as the bacon wrapped Sonoran Dog, or the Portuguese Hawaiian Sausage, with spicy Mad Mike\u2019s sausage combined with sweet pineapple flavors. Of course, fans can build their own hot dog or sausage creations with the ever growing list of toppings. \n \n\u201cLast week, we added mushrooms to our list,\u201d Swanger said. \u201cIt\u2019s always fun to see just how high people can top their hot dogs or sausages.\u201d \n \nAlong with the multiple specialty dogs and sandwiches, Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs also makes their own hand-cut French fries, onion rings, and homemade potato chips. \n \n\u201cWe consider ourselves farm to table here, even though our farm is in Arizona,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is homemade here in the shop.\u201d \n \n Hand Dipped Corn Dogs are sweet and crunchy, \u201clike we get at the fair!\u201d as one child described the tasty offering. Shown over a bed of hand cut fries and homemade potato chips, Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs can turn anything on their gourmet menu into a corn dog. Ashley Ludwig photo.   \nSide dishes for the gourmet offerings are just as one would expect from a corner hot dog shop, with the added benefit of Swanger\u2019s special touch. \n \nThe coleslaw is her family recipe, not creamy but sliced thin, crisp cabbage and poppy seeds made in small batches and tossed in an apple cider vinaigrette. This slaw complements the perfectly prepared hotdogs and sausages. Her potato salad, in a nod to deviled eggs, has a kick and just the right balance of sweet, salt, and heat with the addition of paprika and pimento. \n \nBringing Mad Mike\u2019s Sausages into the mix was a natural choice for Swanger, making gourmet hot dogs the order of the day. From mild to wild, the big name in local sausage can be fully tasted here. \n \n\u201cMad Mike\u2019s adds that amazing flavor for every dog and sausage, except those listed as Vienna Beef hot dogs,\u201d she said. \u201cHis chicken sausage is simply the best I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d \n \nThe gourmet Sonoran Dog, a bacon wrapped 8-inch hot dog, topped with refried beans, flavorful homemade guacamole, pico de gallo and drizzled with sour cream all on a sweet hot dog bun will satisfy lovers of the traditional Mexican hot dog. Swanger\u2019s guacamole will have you begging for the recipe though it\u2019s a trade secret. The hand-cut chips are an ideal side for this dish, salted, light and crisp, not greasy in any way. \n \n A whimsical example of \u201cfarm to table,\u201d Suzette Swanger shows how the potatoes from their grower transform into the thinly sliced potato chips they make and serve daily at Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs. Ashley Ludwig photo.   \n\u201cWe\u2019re becoming famous for our chips,\u201d she said. \n \nFans and friends of Devil Dogs can come for any game, any time, and the television will never be turned off before the game is done. \n \n\u201cWe won\u2019t throw people out just because it\u2019s after our closing time, if the game goes long,\u201d she said. \n \n\u201cThe name, \u2018Devil Dogs\u2019 is a United States Marine Corps reference, though our family isn\u2019t in the military,\u201d she said. \u201cWe kept that name because we are proud to be Americans, and of our soldiers in this military town. That\u2019s why we decided to focus on Patriot Day for a raffle and fundraiser.\u201d \n \nThe donations for this fundraiser, to raise funds toward the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command Foundation are growing daily. \n \n\u201cWe are big fans of this local charitable foundation that raises funds for local Marine families,\u201d she said. \u201cThat, and with Patriot Day coming, we knew we needed to do something to help.\u201d \n \n A United States Marine Corps commemorative poker chip was a gift to Suzette Swanger, from one of her many military guests. Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs is a friend to the military and those who have served. Ashley Ludwig photo.   \nThe Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs fundraiser will run from Friday, Sept. 11 through Tuesday, Sept. 15 with all proceeds benefitting the MARSOC Foundation. Raffle items will include Mad Mike\u2019s American Gourmet Products, a golf package, and a guitar donated by Pabst Blue Ribbon. \n \n\u201cWhen we learned about the MARSOC Foundation, we knew we needed to do something to draw attention to this organization,\u201d she said. \n \nFind Devil Dogs Gourmet Hot Dogs in Temecula at 43810 Butterfield Stage Rd #102.

He's a great man with a warm heart, and generosity, and I'm very proud of him.\" \n \nShe said she was \"very shocked\" by what had happened and added: \"I'm glad that no one's hurt and everything is going to be fine.\" \n \nAsked if he is always so cool and calm, she said: \"Yes, most of the time, and he's loved by everyone, we are very proud of him.\" \n \nShe did not have to worry if he had been involved in the incident, because he rang her to tell her about it, then she watched the news. \n \nShe confirmed he is about to retire, adding: \"Unfortunately what happened, we couldn't have predicted.\" \n \nHis ex-wife Marnie, who is a former cabin crew member and with whom he has a daughter, expressed her relief that he and the rest of the crew got out safely. \n \n\"He is safe and happy,\" she told the Guardian. \"I've had some messages from him. He did a bloody good job.\" \n \nFire officials said at least 14 people were taken to hospital with minor injuries, mostly caused by sliding down the inflatable chutes to escape. \n \nThe airport released a statement which said it was first alerted to the emergency at 4.13pm local time (12.13am BST) and within five minutes everyone was off the plane and the blaze was extinguished. \n   Promoted stories   \nAn audio recording which appears to be the conversation between the captain and air traffic control shows how efficiently the emergency was dealt with. \n \nSpeaking calmly and clearly, th e pilot said: \"Mayday, mayday, Speedbird 2276 request fire services.\" \n \nThe woman in the control tower immediately replied: \"Heavy fire services on the way.\" \n \nForty seconds later the captain added: \"We are evacuating on the runway. We have a fire. I repeat, we are evacuating.\" \n \nAccording to reports the captain was applauded by passengers when he spoke to them in the safety of the terminal building. \n \nBA would not confirm the identity of the captain but said he was \" very experienced and has flown with British Airways for 42 years\". \n \nA spokeswoman for the airport said the passengers were evacuated \"quickly and safely\". \n \nShe went on: \" We cannot express enough gratitude to the emergency response crews, as well as the British Airways crew.\" \n \nThe BA flight from Las Vegas was set to depart for the 10-hour flight to Gatwick when the crew noticed the fire. \n \nBA issued a statement which said the plane \"experienced a technical issue\" and the crew \"evacuated the aircraft safely\". \n \nThe airline added it had provided hotel accommodation and was organising alternative flights for its 157 customers, while those who had been taken to hospital had since been discharged.. \n \nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US  said four investigators had been sent to examine the aircraft, including engine, systems and fire specialists. \n \nBA would not reveal how many Britons were on the plane, although the  Las Vegas to Gatwick route is popular with UK leisure travellers. \n \nJacob Steinberg, a Guardian sports reporter who was on the flight, said the captain told passengers there had been a \"catastrophic\" engine failure. \n \nHe tweeted: \" Was asleep as the plane took off. Came to a crashing halt. Smell of smoke. Initially told to stay seated, then shout of evacuate. \n \n\"Could smell and see smoke but was on other side of plane. One person said fire melted a couple of windows. \n \n\"They opened the back door and slide went down and smoke started coming in plane, followed by mad dash to front. A lot of panic.\" \n   \n Share article  \n   \nBoeing said in a statement that it was \"prepared to provide technical assistance to the NTSB following today's incident\". \n \nMcCarran is a major airport in the US, handling almost 43 million passengers a year.","title":"'Hero' British Airways captain hailed after engine fire on Las Vegas runway","media-type":"News","source":"Surrey Comet","published":"2015-09-09T23:26:53Z"}

The youngest competitor lining  up in\r\nthe world's biggest kids race is seven, whilst the oldest competitor is 77.\r \n \n\n \nThe stunning venue, located in the heart of Kent,  welcomes competitors\r\nfrom across the UK and internationally in a series of  distances and\r\nchallenges (including the biggest children's triathlon in the  world). Its\r\nposition at the end of the busy triathlon calendar and the final  stop on\r\nthe Castle Triathlon Series means that there is a party-like festival\r\natmosphere as triathletes sign off their season with PB's, new distances\r\nachieved or sporting success shared with their friends of families. The\r\natmosphere is boosted by 500 camping through the weekend and lots of\r\nentertainment including bands, climbing walls, archery, trade stands, fun\r\nfair  and pleasure rides. \n \nThe event attracts some of the best triathletes in  Britain who are set\r\nto race hard and fast for their share of the trophies and  prize money. Up\r\nfor grabs this year is a prize fund of \u00a38,000 that stands at\r\n\u00a32,000  for the Standard Distance race, whilst those triumphing in the\r\ntoughest  challenge of the day, the half-iron Gauntlet race, will also take\r\nhome their  share of \u00a32,000. Further prizes are given for Series\r\nwinners. \n Favourites  for The Gauntlet 2015 titles  \nThe Gauntlet at Hever Castle is the biggest test in  the Castle Triathlon\r\nSeries. The half-iron distance triathlon takes competitors  into the rolling\r\nhills of the Kent Weald and through an \u2018area of outstanding  beauty'.\r\nTriathletes who took on the 1.9km swim, 90km bike and 21km run last  year\r\nunequivocally reviewed it as one of the \u2018must-do' events in the UK and\r\nattracted  to the challenge, the field has grown once again this year from\r\n200 in 2013 to  now over 850 \u2013 making it one of the most popular in\r\nthe country. \n \nSpearheading the men's field will be the intriguing  re-match between\r\nDarren Jenkins (Bastion 2015 champion) and Karl Alexander  (Hever Castle\r\nGauntlet 2013 champion). These two had an awesome battle at Hever  Castle\r\nearlier this year over the iron-distance Bastion Triathlon in July, with\r\nJenkins emerging on top with his fearsome run proving the decisive factor.\r\nNow set  to battle it out again over the middle distance, will Jenkins once\r\nagain have  the upper hand, or will the shorter distance suit Alexander who\r\nwill have less  run course to cover before the finish line comes? These\r\nquestions and more will  all be answered over the race. \n \nJenkins and Alexander won't have it all their own  way as there is talent\r\nthroughout the field, not least in the form of XTERRA  professional Matt\r\nDewis, Irish Middle Distance champion Kevin Thornton and  talented racer\r\nWill Cowan \u2013 who can all challenge for the podium and have the  class\r\nto win. \n \nBritish and Scottish Middle Distance Champion Nikki  Bartlett is in the\r\nfield and is the clear favourite for the women's title at  Hever Castle\r\nGauntlet Triathlon. \n \nAlso in the field is Pete Dyson, Andy Dyson, Max  Hazell, Ben Matthews,\r\nColin Norris, Ben Pritchard and Neil Tandy. The women's  race will feature\r\nBex Milnes and Kim Morrison. \n Olympic  distance speedsters  \nWhilst the Gauntlet represents a test of speed over  distance at Hever\r\nCastle Triathlon, the speed kings and queens will take on the  Olympic\r\ndistance triathlon, which comprises of the shorter (but no less  testing),\r\ndistances of 1.5km swim, 40km bike and 10km run. Competing for these  titles\r\nwill be elite athletes including Liam Lloyd, Phil Edgley, James Fearn,\r\nCalum Johnson, William Kirk and Scott Thompson. \n \nThe women's race looks particularly exciting, with Catherine  Jameson\r\nheadlining the field. Jameson is a fearsome competitor on the Castle\r\nTriathlon Series circuit and has picked up wins at Chateau du Chantilly,\r\nCastle  Howard and Cholmondeley already this year. Jameson is such a fan of\r\nthe Hever  Castle Triathlon that she has published her top ten reasons to do\r\nthe race HERE . \n \nHever Castle would complete the set. However, a  challenge will come from\r\nanother former Hever Castle Champion, Vicky Johnston  and also from the\r\nreigning European Aquathlon Champion Hannah Kitchen. \n Hever Castle  \u2013 the \u2018must-do British\r\nrace'  \nIn just six years the Hever Castle Triathlon has  swiftly established\r\nitself as an essential destination for British and  international\r\ntriathletes, garnering plaudits and mainstream media attention  for its\r\npicture postcard venue, elite action, age-group choice and festival\r\natmosphere.  There are no fewer than 14  race choices on offer making it one\r\nof the biggest events in the UK. \n \nTo cement the race's title as the world's largest  children's triathlon,\r\nover 1,600 junior athletes are expected to take part. \n \nThe races will begin with an amended and unique  open-water swim in the\r\nspectacular 38 acre Hever Castle Lake and River Eden.  This creates an\r\nincredible spectacle that is  rewarding for both the athletes and the\r\nspectators who can see one of the most  exciting parts of the race up-close.\r\nCompetitors in The Gauntlet will take on a  single 1.9km lap whilst those\r\nracing in the Olympic distance will take on (for  the first time), a single\r\n1.5km lap. \n \n\n \nThose taking part will then transition onto the  undulating cycle that\r\ntakes athletes around a 20km circuit through the High  Weald of Kent, an\r\nArea of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with one lap for the  Sprint and two\r\nlaps for the Olympic-distance racers. Those on The Gauntlet will  be on a\r\nspecially designed two-lap course. The largely off-road run  circumnavigates\r\nthe estate and award-winning castle grounds before making the  dash to the\r\ntree-lined finishing chute beside the lake. \n  Fun for  spectators too  \nThis year there is even more planned for friends,  family and all the\r\nsupporters at the Hever Castle Triathlon Triathlon, with a  variety of live\r\nmusic, family games and of course a brilliant atmosphere for  all.

And if they carry a payload, it could be anything from a weapon to anthrax to something worse than that.\" \n\nDrone crashes, two days apart, at the U.S. Open in New York and before a Kentucky football game, made news earlier this month. But over the past two years, more than 50 unmanned aircrafts have flown over Major League Baseball and NFL stadiums, coming and going quietly \u2014 usually controlled by a hobbyist who either lost control of the device or wanted a picture of their favorite team in action. \n\nNo harm done. But the prospect of the drones doing something worse has security experts looking for answers, and quickly. \n\nLast October, the Federal Aviation Administration issued notice that it's illegal to fly drones near Major League Baseball, NFL and NCAA Division I college football games and major auto races. Other sporting events can put their own bans in place. But the penalties for violating a ban \u2014 and who hands out those sentences \u2014 is still murky. \n\nIn the Kentucky case, campus police brought wanton endangerment charges against the owner of the wayward drone; at the U.S. Open, New York police brought similar charges against a high school science teacher who lost control of his drone. \n\nThe FAA issued a \"law enforcement guidance\" paper to help local jurisdictions figure out this new problem. It lists its own enforcement tools \u2014 including warning notices, letters of correction and civil penalties \u2014 but suggests state and local police do most of the work to detect the drones and enforce the penalties. \n\nIn its notice about temporary flight restrictions at sporting events, the FAA lists reckless endangerment, operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence, trespassing and assault as possible criminal charges for unsanctioned drone use. \n\nMuch of this, experts say, is the result of seat-of-the-pants law- and rule-making to combat a new and very fluid problem. And none of it addresses the most important issue: How to prevent a drone from coming into a stadium in the first place. \n\n\"So much of this is unknown and so much of it raises so many questions,\" said Derek Catsam of University of Texas of the Permian Basin, who studies stadium security issue. \"It's a case of where the technology is so far ahead of our ability to come to grips with it.\" \n\nThere are around 2,500 Major League Baseball games a year, so 31 drone sightings last year and nine so far this season does not constitute a major crisis, said John Skinner, the director of security for MLB. Still, baseball took part in a government project called \"Operation Foul Ball\" last year at the All-Star Game in Minneapolis to try to detect drones. \n\nSkinner said Minneapolis police worked with the Department of Homeland Security on a system that could identify the radio frequencies of drones before they took off. \n\n\"In essence, it worked,\" he said. \n\nBut it didn't necessarily protect against the drones taking off; one found its way to the stadium during the home run derby. Also, there are private companies that can provide the same service using similar technology, and some of the teams have been approached about working with those companies. \n\nAmong the dozens of uses for drones at sports facilities is attaching cameras to get before-impossible angles for the TV broadcasts. In January, ESPN cleared numerous regulatory hurdles so it could have drones with cameras follow skiers and snowboarders down the hill for the Winter X Games. \n\nESPN got approval only by ensuring it would not fly the drones over spectators or in the air space of planes flying in and out of a nearby airport. \n\nChris Calcinari, who spearheaded the approvals process for ESPN, called it a big opportunity because \"I don't think there are many events that would actually allow us to fly a drone.\" \n\nAnother application: For security. It's possible that drones themselves could be used to keep renegade drones away from fans. And a drone can hover over a stadium to look for weapons, fights and other disruptions. \n\nThe idea of \"good\" drones and \"bad\" drones flying over the same stadium may seem like stuff of the future. But it's an idea that's not too farfetched. \n\n\"We're in that infant stage of, what does this all mean and where is it going?\" Marciani said. \"It's too early to know. You're crawling. You're not even standing up yet.\"","title":"Drones at stadiums are easy to spot, but hard to stop","media-type":"News","source":"Belleville News Democrat","published":"2015-09-17T07:22:08Z"}

All defendants have denied many of the allegations outlined in the lawsuit.\n\nIn August 2015, a new witness came forward alleging that Hipps had been ordered to walk along a narrow bridge railing as part of a hazing ritual before falling to his death.\n\nSolicitor Chrissy Adams later released a statement calling the witness\u2019 credibility into question and said the case was still at a halt.\n\nThe Hipps\u2019 family\u2019s attorney also released a statement saying the family was disappointed by the solicitor\u2019s public remarks about the witness\u2019 information and again asked anyone who knew what may have happened to Hipps to come forward.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sheriff Crenshaw released the following statement about the case.\n\nThe Oconee County Sheriff\u2019s Office has received numerous media inquiries concerning the one year anniversary of the death of Tucker Hipps.

As chances of gaining admission to top institutes declines, students end up devoting years of study and preparation without realistic expectation of success. However, there are other options for students out there! If you want to be judged holistically, if you are a smart individual but bad test-taker, or if you are simply hankering for global exposure, applying abroad is your best route forward. \n \nApplying to top institutes overseas requires a combination of factors. The first are the exams\u2014you may take either GRE\/ GMAT as most colleges accept these tests. These tests are less comprehensive in material covered than the CAT and are only one part of your whole application. \n \nStudents also need to prepare their professional CVs, speak to professors for recommendation letters, write individual essays for each college, and ready themselves for interviews. In the strongest applications, each of these components is well-rounded. \n \nStudents may help themselves greatly by gaining experience in their respective field through internships and work experiences. Colleges often try to \u201clook beyond the numbers,\u201d for applicants\u2014looking beyond just marks. Work experience, an understanding of one\u2019s own caliber, and plentiful involvement with social projects and campus service all go toward strengthening the applicant\u2019s profile \n \nIt is important to receive right counseling in navigating these requirements. A good counselor can help shortlist colleges according to \u201cfit,\u201d i.e. through their suitability for individuals instead of blindly following rankings. Counseling can introduce you to programs like HBS 2+2 or YLP or even similar courses likes MIM, LBS etc. By working with an experienced mentor, you can maximize chances of admission by picking the right courses and the right schools. They can also help write essays showcasing yourself most positively, run through mock interviews with you, and keep your focus on the final goal\u2014admission at a top university! A mentor can also help you apply to correct scholarships and funding sources, as expenses are a major concern for all applicants. Ensure your counselor is suggesting the best colleges for you, not their own pocket. \n \nThere are many non-Indian options for higher education. If one does badly in CAT\/GMAT\/GRE, they can apply to Singapore\/UK. Many colleges do not even require GMAT scores and only require undergraduate marks. However, you must be careful as both countries have several sub-standard institutions that are moneyspinners, not educational enterprises. But colleges like Bath, CASS, LSE, LBS, NUS, SMU, and NTU have tremendous value. \n \nFor CAT you must prepare all year, and be judged on one exam. Since there is only one round a year, risks are high and students eventually have fewer choices. Applying to the US\/UK\u2019s top MBA programs allows for much more autonomy in the process. At the same time, you will be exposed to world-leading resources, cutting-edge facilities, global networking opportunities, and an international peer group. While it might seem scary, with the right guidance you can achieve admission to top MBA programs worldwide. \n \nThe writer, Mr. Rohan Ganeriwala, is the Co-founder, of Collegify, an educational institute for study abroad)","title":"Life Beyond CAT & MAT!!","media-type":"News","source":"This Week Bangalore","published":"2015-09-22T15:07:41Z"}

Lake County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Christopher Covelli said hundreds of officers were involved in the exhaustive search in Fox Lake following the killing of Lt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz on Tuesday morning. But to no avail. \"That means we're not searching within that perimeter area anymore. The suspects were not within our perimeter,\" Covelli told The Associated Press Wednesday morning. \"We had over 400 police officers out here yesterday. We had over 45 canine units and numerous aircraft,\" he said, adding that officers would now conduct \"saturation patrols\" in a wider area. Authorities from across the state and region joined the\u00a0manhunt\u00a0Tuesday in the village about 60 miles north of Chicago. Some wore tactical gear and toted high-powered rifles. Officers took up positions on rooftops and along railroad tracks, scanning the terrain with rifle scopes and binoculars. Others leaned out of helicopters with weapons at the ready. Federal agencies, SWAT teams and 48 police dogs assisted in the\u00a0manhunt, Covelli said. Residents of the usually sleepy village were urged to stay indoors, and schools were on lockdown. In a statement late Tuesday, Covelli urged the community to reach out with tips and leads. Covelli said Gliniewicz radioed in Tuesday morning to tell dispatchers he was chasing three men on foot. Communication with him was lost soon after. Covelli said backup officers found him injured with a gunshot wound and that he died soon after. An emotional Fox Lake Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend, a three-decade member of the department and a father of four sons. \"We lost a family member,\" Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as \"GI Joe.\" ''His commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed.\" The area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. Some longtime city dwellers move to the region for what is normally a quieter lifestyle. Authorities urged residents to stay home while they searched for the suspects, two of them white and the other black. Commuter train service was halted, and residents who wanted to take their dogs out to relieve themselves were told to stay inside, with the job of walking the pets handled by police officers. Several schools were locked down Tuesday, and seven cancelled classes on Wednesday, Covelli said. Gliniewicz's death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. It says firearms-related deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared to the same period last year, Jan. 1. to Sept. 1; there were 30 last year and 26 this year. Fox Lake residents expressed sorrow at the death of the immensely popular Gliniewicz. \"This particular officer is a pillar in my community and (is) definitely going to be missed, and (he) touched so many lives,\" said Gina Maria, a 40-year-old teacher. Dozens gathered for hours along a street in the village to show their support for law enforcement officers. Thirty-year-old Dan Raminick, who held a sign reading \"Police Lives Matter,\" said officers came by Tuesday evening and thanked the crowd. Caitlyn Kelly, a 22-year-old student, said she felt compelled to come out after other recent police shootings. She held a sign that said \"Blue and Brave.\"","title":"Hunt for 3 suspects in Illinois officer's death continues","media-type":"News","source":"Wicked Local Boxborough","published":"2015-09-01T19:48:55Z"}

{"id":"3b985539-a695-4edd-826d-3b343967cef8","content":"Sageworks\u2019 new Electronic Tax Return Reader automatically imports data, improving efficiency and accuracy. \n \n\nThe $2.1 billion, Briarwood, N.Y.-based Melrose Credit Union is giving rave reviews of its experience with the Raleigh, N.C.-based Sageworks\u2019 new Electronic Tax Return Reader, which the credit union said helps improve underwriting efficiency. \n\nSageworks introduced the Electronic Tax Return Reader as a major time-saving enhancement to its suite of credit risk management solutions for financial institutions. The complimentary upgrade automatically imports data from borrowers\u2019 tax returns. \n\n\u201cI am ecstatic with this product so far,\u201d Steven Krauser, senior vice president of retail operations for Melrose CU, told CU Times . \n\nHe explained that because the credit union's lending portfolio is so diverse, systematizing the evaluation of its underwriting process was a priority. Based on the NCUA's requirements, the credit union needed to provide the matrix for evaluating a loan in a standardized manner across all product lines. \n\nKrauser, who joined Melrose CU about a year ago, explained one of his goals was to study what the credit union could do better and began researching software that would allow him to do that. \n\n\u201cWe started in business in 1922 in taxi medallion financing,\u201d Krauser said. \u201cWe have a significant portfolio in that. That is one reason we wanted to get involved in this.\u201d \n\nThe credit union also desired the ability to flag any problems in advance by adjusting and stress testing its portfolio, and to quantify and maintain its methodology. \n\nMelrose CU, which has an open charter and one branch, investigated which lending modules would integrate with its core system's existing data as well as standardize underwriting within its departments. The Sageworks suite, Krauser explained, allows the credit union to stress test its portfolio based on numerous factors such as loan to value, debt service coverage ratio changes and interest rate increases. \n\nThe credit union started fully underwriting with the system on Aug. 4, 2015. \n\n\u201cThe quality of the underwriting analysis has increased dramatically,\u201d Krauser pointed out, adding that the timesaving benefit will come later on. \u201cThe reason it is not there yet is that it is new and we\u2019re still learning what to do, so there still is a learning curve.\u201d \n\nLibby Berman, an analyst for Sageworks, said, \u201cOur bread and butter at Sageworks has always been commercial loans and business lending, so the tax packages we support are mostly those commercial properties that accounting firms used for their businesses. We supply our financial institution clients with products that help them comply with regulations and improve their efficiency.\u201d \n\nThe Electronic Tax Return Reader works by optically \u201creading\u201d electronic tax returns produced by many common tax packages, allowing for the creation of digital returns in the Sageworks system, where other financial information is also imported and stored. The program also benefits credit departments that analyze commercial real estate borrower information, as it also automatically populates Schedule E financial information for real estate properties. \n\nSageworks said the enhancement allows credit unions to save a significant amount of time. \n\n\u201cOur users are spending about 30 minutes per return on average, and obviously, some tax returns are much more complex with many real estate properties,\u201d Berman pointed out. \n\nThrough this program and its technology, that time can be pared down to two to three minutes, he said. \n\n\u201cI don't know that a lot of our clients even knew this technology was feasible,\u201d Berman added. \u201cIt has just been a recurring theme since we got into the credit analysis business, making sure that data was accurate and entered quickly. It is something people kind of expected. This will proactively solve most of those problems.\u201d \n\nIn addition to saving users time, the Electronic Tax Return Reader aims to reduce errors that can occur during the manual data entry process, and ensure consistency and accuracy during the production of commercial borrower spreads within the Sageworks Credit Analysis tool. For applicable tax returns, the technology ensures different analysts across an institution are inputting data the same way, which helps give credit unions a strong defense during exams. \n\nBerman said Sageworks also helps clients maintain consistency. \n\n\u201cIn the past, maybe there were multiple people entering data, and it is very easy to transpose numbers or enter something on the wrong line,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe auto import helps eliminate inconsistencies and errors. The system also allows the financial institution the capability to go back in and make adjustments.\u201d \n\nMelrose CU implemented Sageworks\u2019 entire suite of cloud-based products about three and a half months ago, Krauser said. \n\n\u201cWithin that time, we were able to learn it, train our people, create a test site, play with it and then map our fields from our core system into the Sageworks system,\u201d he noted. \n\nKrauser said Sageworks performs all calculations for Melrose CU. \n\n\u201cIt gives us the debt to service coverage ratio, loan to value and matrix on individual loans that we are doing, plus it gives us all the same information on global cash flow for those individuals and does it for our entire portfolio on that individual. So if you have a loan here and you are asking for a car loan, we can do the analysis on that car loan to see if it makes [financial] sense.\u201d \n\nCurrently, Melrose CU uses Sageworks\u2019 tools for its commercial real estate department, taxi medallion lending area and business services unit. Krauser explained the credit union will eventually introduce Sageworks into its personal lending area as well, but first, it wants to gain full confidence using the tools for the largest portion of its lending business. \n\n\u201cWe have a real robust program here, and we want to make sure we have all the pieces and understand the full breadth and depth of it before we introduce it into other aspects,\u201d Krauser said. \u201cIt is really a great automation of the process.\u201d \n\nScott Ogle, CEO for Sageworks, noted, \u201cSageworks offers solutions that simplify the complex processes that financial institutions handle every day. A key objective when developing or enhancing our solutions is to maximize time and efficiency. With our customer needs in mind, we developed the Electronic Tax Return Reader to become an integral component of each of our banking solutions, as it will save hours of manual data entry over the life of the solution.\u201d \n\nSageworks Credit Analysis allows credit unions to book loans faster, and with consistency and transparency, while also managing risk, the company said. The global cash flow analysis solution presents tax return input screens that create spreads, dynamic narrative analysis and customizable credit memos. \n\n\u201cThis is also important to those credit unions that are getting into more member business lending, who may not feel they have the right staff in place,\u201d Berman asserted. \u201cThey can use a program like this to take care of some of the more manual work and allocate time more effectively to the actual analysis.\u201d \n\nBerman pointed out the credit analysis tool also helps credit unions prepare for exams, especially those that had trouble in the past with credit decision inconsistencies and file errors.","title":"Sageworks Automates Tax Data for Credit Unions","media-type":"News","source":"Credit Union Times","published":"2015-09-18T04:00:00Z"}

The valves, which are designed to support low pressure exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) for diesel engines and acoustic tuning for gasoline engines, feature a unique new modular design which offers vehicle manufacturers custom flexibility and adaptability for any engine architecture. \n\nThis Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20150916005157\/en\/ \n\nTenneco's latest generation electronic valves feature a unique new modular design, which offers vehicle manufacturers custom flexibility and adaptability for any engine architecture. (Photo: Business Wire) \n\n\"We've seen a dramatic shift with our valve technology since its introduction just three years ago,\" said Tim Jackson, executive vice president and chief technology officer, Tenneco. \"Tenneco's latest generation valve has evolved to a modular, scalable design that is lightweight, can be easily packaged to fit within any engine architecture and offers on-demand customization, which provides significant cost and time savings for customers. Additionally, the valve can accommodate exhaust temperature specifications up to 750\u00b0C for EGR applications, which enables efficient NOx reduction - even with highly loaded engine conditions and high return flow rates.\" Tenneco's latest generation valve features a dynamic flap control designed to generate optimal pressure conditions for efficient EGR and also provides fail-safe operation. The actuator is interchangeable using a simple mounting concept without any loose interface components and the valve's flexible actuator orientation allows for simple installation in any engine control environment, without the need to change parts. \n\nThe valve delivers important acoustical benefits as well. Whether during engine start or while idling, the flap minimizes internal leakage, which helps to optimize sound quality. The electronically controlled variable flap remains closed during normal driving conditions for a quieter ride and opens during harder acceleration, creating lower backpressure, higher attenuation and more engine power for maximum efficiency. \n\n\"Tenneco's new valve design serves as another important example of how our emissions technologies serve as enablers for improving fuel efficiency and helping customers meet important emissions regulations like EU6c, while maximizing engine performance,\" Jackson said. \"In the future, we'll continue to see valve technology evolve into hotter areas of the vehicle and we are already in development with valves that provide exhaust heat recovery solutions to address that need.\" \n\nTenneco is displaying these and other clean air and ride performance technologies at its exhibit during the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, September 15-27, Hall 5.1, Stand A20. \n\nTenneco is an $8.4 billion global manufacturing company with headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois and approximately 29,000 employees worldwide.Tenneco is one of the world's largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of clean air and ride performance products and systems for automotive and commercial vehicle original equipment markets and the aftermarket.Tenneco's principal brand names are Monroe\u00ae, Walker\u00ae, XNOx\u2122 and Clevite\u00aeElastomer.

{"id":"44fc3bf2-c154-4df6-b0bd-7f4c26649dca","content":"The emergent problem of the dangerous drugs known as synthetics has been featured in several recent media accounts. Their use has grown strikingly, and because of their association with violent behavior, so has law enforcement concern. The rising trend was shown in reports of emergency episodes attributed to \u201csynthetic cannabinoids\u201d by the District of Columbia Fire and EMS departments. Episodes had been stable at fewer than fifty cases a month from August, 2012, until roughly November of that year, when they spiked to over a hundred. \n \nThat number subsided until approximately January of 2015, when they began an unprecedented, and persisting, climb. By June of 2014, the last data point captured, they reached 439 cases, an apparent increase of nearly 800 percent since the end of the year. \n \nOur attention has been triggered by some horrendous episodes involving consumption of synthetics, including an alleged stabbing death that has the city, already known for far greater use of the synthetic hallucinogen PCP among arrestees than other major cities, on edge. \n \nHas some underlying factor driven synthetic cannabinoid use in the nation\u2019s Capital, as shown by these emergency episodes? What has changed that could affect either drug availability, or the acceptability of increased use, of this dangerous set of compounds? \n \nThere is a correlation found in the timing. In November of 2014, District voters made news by approving legal \u201cnatural\u201d cannabinoid use in the city \u2013 that is, marijuana. Then, in January of this year, the legalization took effect, with an increase in public consumption, while police backed away. Both developments seem to be echoed in the data. \n \nWe must confront a disturbing question: by allowing \u201cnatural\u201d marijuana to increase in acceptance, could the District have sowed the wind of the synthetic cannabis whirlwind? \n \nAdvocates for drug legalization recognize that connection, but their response is the predictable resort of pro-marijuana advocates.  Legalizers explain the increased use of synthetics as a consequence of the prohibition on \u201cnatural cannabis.\u201d But that had ended just before the epidemic began. So how could prohibition be forcing the problem? The response from legalizers is revealing, as it discloses their next target in District policies: workplace drug testing. Since many synthetic users believe that they are not readily detected by potential employers, they must be substituting them for the \u201cnatural\u201d marijuana product. \n \nSo for legalizers, it is still the \u201cpunitive criminal justice system\u201d that somehow incentivizes use of dangerous synthetic toxins. As they perennially argue, it is our crack-down on marijuana that drives consumers to more dangerous drugs. \n \nFor advocates, the problem with marijuana legalization in the District is not that it led to a disturbing shift in the attitudes and norms of drugs use. It\u2019s that it didn\u2019t go far enough. We didn\u2019t legalize sales, as well as use. And employers (like the Federal Government) still insist on drug-testing applicants. And because drug users want jobs, they have to use synthetics. \n \nOddly, before November when \u201cnatural marijuana\u201d was prohibited, this argument failed; there was then no spike in synthetic use, even though marijuana users were still, as now, subjected to drug tests. \n \nThe legalizer solution? Legalize marijuana sales, but most importantly, eliminate workplace testing. That will surely end the demand for synthetics. \n \nIt\u2019s possible that the cause of the current epidemic is, as legalizers argue,  this complicated incentive effect. But isn\u2019t it simpler, and more faithful to the data, to posit that the District made a huge, predictable mistake when it opened the flood gates to legalized marijuana, and thereby shifted the entire drug using landscape towards an epidemic? \n \nThe argument is not far-fetched. Perceptions and norms of disapproval matter for those contemplating drug use, and survey data are clear that for youth, there is a strong correlation between one prior behavior and use of synthetic drugs. Data from a study overseen by the National Institute of Drug Abuse showed that the use of \u201cnatural\u201d marijuana is, in fact, a \u201cgateway\u201d for synthetic use. In fact, the use of synthetics by those who hadn\u2019t previously used marijuana is 0.5 percent; that is, almost never. \n \nThe true common sense understanding of the tragedy happening right before us is that the District of Columbia, by legalizing marijuana, produced a completely predictable effect. It made drug use more acceptable, and rendered police control more difficult. Sadly, as drugs of all sorts begin to flood the streets, the District is experiencing a rapidly-unfolding train wreck, of its own devising.","title":"Synthetic Problem: Has D.C.

The to cities and low interest loans to recycling companies.\n\nThe first three recycling investments total $24 million.\n\nClosed Loop Fund\u2019s first investee is a joint venture between QRS and Canusa-Hershman (CHR) to create a one-of-a-kind plastic recovery facility (PRF) in Baltimore, Maryland. Currently, 70 percent of communities across the US are not able to collect and recycle #3-#7 plastics, like yogurt containers and take out packaging or large rigid plastics such as crates, buckets, baskets and lawn furniture.\n\nThe Closed Loop Fund says tor the first time ever, QRS and CHS will combine technology that can both separate these products and turn them back into raw materials for new products and packaging. The facility is able to process 4,500 tons of materials every month \u2014 double the capacity of what\u2019s presently possible in the US.\n\nBeginning in October, QRS-CHR will service the majority of the East Coast, from Maine to South Carolina, increasing recycling rates and finally providing a recycling solution for #3-#7 plastics. The fund expects the opening of the facility to help divert 440,000 tons from landfills and reduce 555,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nClosed Loop Fund\u2019s two other investments are in Quad Cities, Iowa, and Portage County, Ohio, both important Midwest markets for recycling. These investments will allow the two communities to convert from dual-stream recycling systems to single-stream, making it easier for citizens to recycle. These communities are similar to hundreds across the south and Midwest with citizens who want to recycle, but without a convenient option.\n\nThe fund says over the next 10 years, in Portage County alone, 37,000 tons will be diverted from landfills with a reduction of 110,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. It expects Quad Cities to see 86,000 tons diverted from landfills and 250,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions reduced.\n\nLack of infrastructure is a major barriers to more recycling in the US. In 2013, lack of recycling infrastructure caused US cities to collectively spend over $5 billion dollars to landfill over $11 billion worth of commodities that could have been recycled, according to the Closed Loop Fund.\n\nBy 2025, Closed Loop Fund aims to do the following","title":"Recycling \u2018Game Changer\u2019 Gets $24M Cash Injection","media-type":"News","source":"Environmental Leader","published":"2015-09-28T11:26:20Z"}

Today it was exactly the same. One shot at the edge of the box and one corner were all the offensive volume West Ham had in the whole game. \n \n\"We must concentrate more because two balls decided the result.\" \n \nCity had to make a late change to the side after playmaker David Silva withdrew before kick-off. \n \nPellegrini said: \"I don't want to have the excuse of David Silva why we didn't win. I don't think there was one player that would change the story. \n \n\"David had a kick in his calf and he tried in the warm-up but he felt his muscle was stiff so he didn't play.\" \n \nPellegrini, who added that defender Eliaquim Mangala was taken off at half-time with a muscle injury, dismissed suggestions his team may have been over-confident. \n   Promoted stories   \nHe said: \"We never believed that because we won five games we were the champions of the Premier League. \n \n\"We have to play 32 games more, 96 points to play for, so nobody can believe that.\" \n \nFor West Ham, the result represented another notable away scalp under new boss Slaven Bilic after also winning at Arsenal and Liverpool. \n \nBilic said: \"It is a surprise, let's be honest. This game was different from Emirates and Anfield. With the greatest respect to Liverpool and Arsenal, this team (City) are the best in the league. \n \n\"We knew we would have to score goals to get something, we knew we would have to run like crazy, and we knew would have to be lucky. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to stop them for 90 minutes but we have done it. \n \n\"We didn't nick it. It would have been fair if they equalised, but we also had chances. \n \n\"That is why I am so proud of our performance. The guys have done brilliantly, not only fighting-wise but also playing-wise.\" \n \nThe Hammers now have 12 points from their six games, just three less than leaders City, but Bilic is not getting carried away. \n \nHe said: \"There is a tiny line between confidence and arrogance or confidence and laziness. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"It is hard not to get carried away a little but that is also part of my job to install in their heads that we are good, but that you have to know what to do to stay good. \n \n\"There are going to be ups and downs, we are not Real Madrid, but it is looking very good now.\"","title":"Manuel Pellegrini upset by defensive errors as Manchester City lose to West Ham","media-type":"News","source":"Craven Herald","published":"2015-09-19T22:03:17Z"}

Georgia is unstoppable and does not stop swiveling her hips! Georgia is always hard to tag and will be using her hip swivel to break the line in Sunday\u2019s game. \n\nGeorgia has played years and years of Oztag and this will show come Sunday!\n\nCurrently representing NSW CHS at the national touch football championships (also leading try scorer up in QLD), Taryn will be landing back just in time for the WLT grand final. \n\nA little weapon, nothing will stop her! \n\nDaughter of the Bulldogs' first grade coach Orbit (who wishes he could sign a deal with Taryn), she shines every week with her speed and fast pace, making herself impossible to catch. \n\nTaryn was put into the fullback role while Ebony was away and plays like Jarryd Hayne; anywhere on the field, any position.\n\nPaige is known as the Robbie Farah of the team. \n\nPaige is the \u2018go forward\u2019 and helps to get the girls on a role. \n\nHer ball movement throughout the middle of the field and non-stop communication will be important in Sunday\u2019s game. \n\nShe is the team\u2019s motivation and has filled the team with positivity the whole season! \n\nThere are never any heads dropped while Paigey is around. \n\nPaige's loud mouth and positive energy will help push the girls and get them fired and pumped ready to go. \n\nOne of Paige\u2019s biggest achievements this year is being the only player to kick a 40\/20!\n\nAmy was born in Milton hospital and is a life-long sporting achiever, representing several teams at higher levels. \n\nIt is Amy\u2019s third year with the Bulldogs, and she will be hoping to win a back-to-back premiership alongside the girls. \n\nAmy\u2019s sporting experience will be a big impact on this weekend's game. \n\nAmy is a versatile player and an important utility, able to play any position in both attack and defence to continually stand out. \n\nLook out for her superman dives in defence and dodging stepping attack.\n\nCheyanne Hatch is the captain and leader of this great side. Cheyanne is the daughter of coach David Hatch, who has not only played years with the Cronulla Sharks and Australia, he has captained and coached more than 20 different teams. \n\nCheyanne is a huge threat in the Bulldogs side and has led the girls now into two grand finals. \n\nShe says she is so proud to be undefeated minor premiers but the job is not done until this Sunday. \n\nHer experience from years representing various representative touch football and Oz Tag sides will be shown on Sunday when the girls defend their premiership. \n\nCheyanne was also awarded Group 7 Player of the year for 2014, which was picked from all teams in the competition.\n\nAlso daughter of the Bulldogs' first grade coach, Orbit, Jaylee will be wearing the red, blue and white representing the doggies with pride. Born a true Milton Ulladulla Bulldog, she is one of our strongest link\/wingers.\n\nJaylee never-give-up attitude and improvement this year has been outstanding. \n\nShe continues to impress her team mates in every game and is a well respected player in this team. \n\nHer best game was when the Bulldogs defeated Kiama in the semi-final two weeks ago, where she has battle scars from diving and defending non-stop. \n\nJaylee not only has the height of the team but is always positively lifting the girls up as a team.\n\nAfter breaking her collarbone in the first game last year, the determination of this little skillful player proves that nothing would stop her return. \n\nWithout older sister Kaela Thomas (who was a stand out in last year's grand final), Georgia has really stepped up. \n\nShe has moves up her sleeve she plans to use on Sunday. \n\nShe has represented Australia in Oztag for several years and again her experience at a higher level will be important for Sunday\u2019s game. \n\nGeorgia\u2019s grubber kicks for herself and for the other girls attacking the line will be a strong point for the Doggies.\n\nGetting mistaken for Shaun Johnson and Roger Tuivasa Sheck, Ana has developed so much as a player this year.\n\nOne of the Dogs' ball players, she sets up a lot of plays and does not miss a tag in defence. \n\nShe loves the Bulldogs and says her favourite part of playing is spending her weekends with her best friends. \n\nHer best memory was winning the grand final last year and being a part of the Bulldogs family. \n\nAna\u2019s hip movements and non-stop defence will play an important role for the girls.\n\nOn debut for the Bulldogs this year, Rachel was always a touch head but decided she would give league tag a crack. \n\nRachel has improved immensely since game one and continues to surprise each game. \n\nLeague tag is not an easy game, but Rachel with her freakish nature and natural ability with a football was able to pick up the game straight away. \n\nRachel\u2019s ball movement from left to right is her biggest strength in the game and this will help trick the defence in Sunday's game.\n\nEmmah has grown up playing soccer her whole life but decided she would give league tag a try. \n\nShe has loved every aspect of the game so far, and with her speed and long legs Emmah is hoping to play her best in Sunday's game. It is Emmah\u2019s second year playing with the Bulldogs and every game she is determined to play her best and gives 100 per cent - that\u2019s what the team loves about her! \n\nEmmah was awarded player of the grand final last year, which was also her favourite Bulldogs memory.\n\nJess is the Bulldogs' backup goal kicker and was lucky enough to be put into the goal kicking role while Ebony was away. \n\nWith big shoes to fill, Jess had no worries of filling them, having a lot of strength behind her boot thanks to her soccer background. \n\nOne of the Bulldogs' strongest wingers in the team, her teammates have every bit of confidence in Jess defending, as she drops back to support the fullback and attacking the line out wide. Do not let Jess into open space as she will be very hard to catch.\n\nThis year was Tessa\u2019s first year with the Bulldogs. \n\nShe began looking up to her partner Stein Lofts (a Bulldogs first grade player of more than 17 years) and he has taught her a thing or two.\n\nHowever she is now teaching him how she uses those hips of hers to break through the defenders. \n\nTessa is definitely the team's best hole runner by far. \n\nTessa came into the team not knowing any of the girls well, now she is happy to say she has made 16 new friends and there is no better feeling playing alongside such a great bunch of girls.\n\nEmily is also away representing NSWCCC at the National touch Champions, making it back in time for Sunday's game. \n\nOnly 17-years-old, Emily is one of the strongest and fastest players across the park. \n\nIt is her first year with the Bulldogs, and what a great sign up she was. \n\nScoring a try almost every game, Emily is a little superstar! \n\nEmily was named in the Youth Rugby Union Australian 7\u2019s side and this can be shown through her speed and agility on the field. \n\nShe never stops smiling and puts in the gutsiest effort every game. \n\nEmily\u2019s favourite Bulldog moment was becoming minor premiers and she hopes to win her first premiership this Sunday, in turn helping the majority of the girls make it their second.\n\nAnother newbie of the team, Hannah has showed the whole season what playing tag is about. \n\nAlso only 17-years-old and an Australia Oztag representative, Hannah is the Bulldogs' weapon and will be a dark horse on Sunday. \n\nShe is planning on coming out strong and giving the other team a run for their money. \n\nHannah is also a try scoring machine and played her best game against Culburra, scoring herself six tries in one game. \n\nHannah bounces off the defence with her fast hips; she should be hard to tag.\n\nIt is Kiarna\u2019s third year with the Doggies and she is also hoping to win a back-to-back premiership. \n\nFrom day one Kiarna has been a part of the team, and not only her team mates, but also the coach have seen nothing but continuous improvements. \n\nShe plays rugby league, which can be shown through her aggression. \n\nKiarna\u2019s great communication and non-stop talking will help the girls in Sunday's game.\n\nCousin of Taryn and Jaylee, this awesome trio will be making the Love family proud on Sunday.\n\nA late sign-up into the team, this year is Riarnne\u2019s first time playing tag. \n\nBeing on debut, Riarnne has improved so much since game one. Her great attitude and positive influences on the girls will be important in Sunday's game. \n\nThe rest of the team cannot wait to share the grand final experience with Riarnne.","title":"Meet the Bulldogs' women's team","media-type":"News","source":"Milton Ulladulla Times","published":"2015-09-18T03:56:54Z"}
{"id":"372c91d3-1ab5-4ce2-9ab4-9d0ca8efc4b5","content":"The resounding endorsement by global leaders last week in New York of the groundbreaking and transformational 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, more than two years in the making, sparks new hope and optimism for multilateralism. \n \nThe 2030 Agenda, based on 17 goals and 169 targets, may seem overly ambitious to some, but poverty eradication cannot be sustained without comprehensive progress in economic growth, social justice and ecological sustainability. This is a bold and inspirational new roadmap that will guide us to more sustainable growth, which is resource-efficient and respects planetary boundaries\uff0dmeeting our present needs without mortgaging the wellbeing of future generations. \n \nThis change is urgently needed in the countries of Asia and the Pacific. Although our region has an impressive track record of economic growth and poverty reduction, more than 1.4 billion people still live in poverty, social disparities are widening and growth remains inefficient and wasteful. Our region has a shared responsibility to lead, which is why mainstreaming the 2030 Agenda in development plans and budgets, and backing them with strong oversight will be critical for successful implementation. \n \nFive conditions must be met to pave the way for Asia-Pacific governments to make this happen: \n \nFirst, sufficient financial resources are needed. The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) estimates that the Asia-Pacific region will need to invest between $2.1 trillion and $2.5 trillion per year to fund a comprehensive agenda for sustainable development. These resources are available: regional national savings total nearly $8.9 trillion, financial assets of the wealthiest regional individuals are estimated to be about $35 trillion, and foreign exchange reserves account for more than $7 trillion. Most of these sources of savings are currently adding to liquidity, held dormant in deposits or financing third-party country deficits. We need instead to effectively harness them along with unwavering political commitment to exploit domestic resources for development. Developing economies of our region have, on an average, among the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world. Leveraging the potential of strengthened tax regimes is key; public interest must override the vested interests so that governments can remove tax exemptions and tackle tax evasion practices which are obstacles to investment in better access to basic services. \n \nSecond, good governance and inclusion has to be embedded in policy execution and implementation. The capacities of governments to engage multiple interest groups with widely varying perspectives, to effectively regulate excesses, monitor policy impacts and adjust policy responses are now critical. Governments must also become more adept at dealing with the unexpected and unpredictable events\uff0dand enabling all groups in society to respond positively to environmental, economic or social shocks. \n \nThird, innovations, new technologies and associated know-how must drive sustainable development across the region, yet innovation gaps in Asia and the Pacific remain very large. Only five Asia-Pacific countries are featured in the top 20 of the 2014 Global Innovation Index. Effective alignment and reinforcement of science, technology and innovation, through the right policies and regulatory frameworks as well as partnerships to facilitate technology transfer, will be mission-critical for successful sustainability. \n \nFourth, we need to pair innovation with resources, enabling countries to find and adapt the best policy options for sustainability. Partnerships and stronger, more diversified regional platforms for South-South cooperation, such as those provided by ESCAP and its Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development, provide great opportunities for our region to lead the way in ending poverty, transforming lives and protecting the planet. \n \nFifth, climate action must be integrated across all areas of policy and governance\uff0dsocial, environmental and economic. While emissions must be reduced through a focus on low-carbon energy, transportation and buildings and through energy efficiency, we must also build more resilient societies, prepared for frequent and extreme weather events and their impacts, such as changes in food production systems and migration. \n \nThe author, Shamshad Akhtar, is an under-secretary-general of the United Nations and executive secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

{"id":"eacc9625-b22d-4a44-a62e-7d53c132af1a","content":"\"It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction,\" Trump said Monday at a press conference at Trump Tower in New York as he unveiled his plan to revamp the tax code. \"It'll simplify the tax code, it'll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn't seen for decades.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated tax plan comes as Trump is being pressed to provide more details about how his administration would govern.\n\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries appears to be families that draw the smallest paychecks. Individuals that make less than $25,000 (and $50,000 for married couples) would pay no income taxes under Trump's plan.\n\nHowever, the proposal would also be a boon for the wealthiest Americans like Trump -- the top bracket includes individuals making $150,001 and more and couples making $300,001 and more -- who would pay an income tax rate of 25%. That's a dramatic cut from the current top rate of close to 40%.\n\nThe tax cuts for top earners could open Trump up to charges of hypocrisy. The real estate magnate has surged to the top of the polls by touting a populist tone, lamenting that wealthy people like himself should pay more.\n\nAsked at Monday's press conference how his proposal would affect his own tax rate, Trump dodged the question, saying: \"We're reducing taxes, but believe me, there will be people in the very upper echelon that won't be thrilled with this.\"\n\nHe also declined to say how much taxes he currently pays, only saying, \"I fight like hell to pay as little as possible.\"\n\nPerhaps the most pressing question that Trump must answer is how he would raise enough revenue to offset his plan's deep tax cuts, though he insisted Monday that his proposal would not add to the country's debt or deficit.\n\nThe candidate says he would make up for the difference in a number of ways: killing certain deductions for the rich and creating incentives for U.S. companies to bring back cash currently held overseas, thereby boosting growth at home.\n\nTrump's tax plan broadly mirrors that of one of his main rivals: Jeb Bush.\n\nBush's proposal released this month also reduces the number of income tax brackets -- to three from the current seven. The highest tax bracket under the former Florida governor's plan is 28%, and the lowest is 10%. Bush also proposed lowering the corporate tax rate from 25% to 20% -- another popular idea among conservatives. Trump would go even further, lowering the rate to 15%.\n\nLike Bush, one loophole Trump would target is the preferential treatment for carried interest, which is a share of profits paid to investment managers.\n\nSince launching his White House campaign in June, Trump has made sweeping attacks on hedge fund managers who are paid in carried interest.\n\nTrump, who claims that his personal assets are valued at more than $10 billion, frequently makes the distinction between investors who work in real estate and those on Wall Street. Hedge fund managers, he often says, fall in the category of special interests backing some of his well-connected and best-funded rivals.\n\n\"I know them. They all are supporting Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton,\" Trump told CNN at a campaign stop in Nashville, Tennessee, last month. \"They make a lot of money and a lot of it is luck. They pick a stock and all of a sudden they make a lot of money. I want the hedge fund guys to pay more taxes.\"\n\nStill, the plan might not be too tough on Wall Street. Since Trump's proposal would slash the income tax rate across the board, taxing carried interest as regular income under Trump's plan would mean investors still pay far less than what they would if the carried interest loophole were done away with under the current tax code.\n\nThe tax rate of hedge fund managers is a favorite political target for the 2016 presidential candidates.\n\n\"We will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you won't be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains,\" Bush's tax proposal said.\n\nIt's also popular rallying cry for the Democratic candidates.\n\nFormer Secretary of Hillary Clinton has been hitting Wall Street tax breaks since the first days of her campaign, as she's faced pressure from progressive Democrats to embrace a more populist agenda. Antagonism towards Wall Street is a central message of Clinton's rivals like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.","title":"Trump promises 'major tax relief' for most Americans","media-type":"News","source":"Las Vegas Review Journal","published":"2015-09-28T17:05:44Z"}

{"id":"e2fac553-db94-482f-bd60-1889853028da","content":"By KUNDUZ CITY, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Taliban fighters battled their way into the centre of Kunduz city in northern Afghanistan on Monday and seized the provincial governor's office, in one of the most serious security breaches in 14 years of war, witnesses and officials said.\n\nThe insurgents raised the white Taliban banner over the central city square and freed hundreds of fellow militants from the local jail, in a major embarrassment for Afghan forces who abandoned a provincial headquarters for the first time.\n\nThe stunning assault came a day before President Ashraf Ghani's unity government marked its first anniversary.\n\nIt was the second time this year that the hardline Islamist movement has besieged Kunduz city, defended by Afghan forces battling largely without NATO's support after it withdrew most of its troops last year. \n\nThe insurgents launched a surprise, three-pronged offensive before dawn, and by evening they had captured the governor's compound and provincial police headquarters, said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesman for the hardline Islamist movement.\n\n\"Our fighters are now advancing towards the airport,\" Mujahid said on his Twitter account.\n\nA senior government official in Kabul confirmed that the provincial headquarters had fallen and Afghan forces were regrouping at the airport.\n\nDozens of Afghan special forces have been flown into Kunduz airport on a C-130 aircraft and were preparing to launch a counter-attack, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"IT LOOKS GRIM\"\n\nThe Kunduz assault marks a troubling development in the insurgency, although Afghan forces have managed to drive the Taliban back from most of the territory they have gained this year during an escalation in violence.\n\n\"It is certainly the first major breach of a provincial capital since 2001,\" said Graeme Smith, senior analyst for International Crisis Group.\n\n\"They are choking the Afghan forces from all sides. It looks pretty grim.\"\n\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan evacuated its Kunduz compound on Monday morning, soon after the assault began.\n\n\"They've been relocated within Afghanistan,\" said U.N. spokesman Dominic Medley, declining to say where or how many staff were evacuated.\n\nAbdullah Danishy, deputy governor of Kunduz, vowed that Afghan forces would retake the occupied city.\n\n\"We have reinforcements coming from other areas and will beat back the Taliban,\" Danishy said by telephone from Kunduz airport after fleeing his office.\n\nBut with much of downtown Kunduz now in Taliban hands and terrified civilians either trying to flee or hiding inside their homes, the insurgents may be tough to dislodge.\n\n\"Once they get inside an urban area, your air assets and artillery become much less useful,\" Smith said.\n\nFAMILIES SEPARATED\n\nThe Taliban were ousted in 2001 after a U.S.-led campaign, and have been fighting to reimpose their rule in sporadic clashes ever since. They have stepped up their offensive this year as NATO forces drew down to just a few thousand troops.\n\nOne Reuters witness saw buildings on fire in the south of the city and Taliban fighters entering a 200-bed government-run hospital.\n\nDozens of panicked residents fled to the city's main airport but were turned away by security forces. \n\nElectricity and phone services were cut across most of the city, and family members struggled to locate one another in the chaos.\n\n\"My uncle's wife has been killed by the Taliban today and still my wife and kids are in the area that the Taliban captured, so it is important to free my family,\" said Matin Safraz, an official at the interior ministry who was visiting Kunduz for the Muslim holiday of Eid.\n\nSafraz had retreated to the airport, and said he was prepared to fight the Taliban with a borrowed AK-47 rifle.\n\nSayed Sarwar Hussaini, a spokesman for Kunduz police, said \n\n20 Taliban fighters had been killed and three Afghan police wounded in the early morning clashes. Updated casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\nAccording to two security officials, Taliban gunmen, some armed with rocket-propelled grenades, overwhelmed security guards and broke into the main city prison, freeing hundreds of fighters.\n\nTaliban spokesman Mujahid urged Kunduz residents to stay inside.\n\n\"The mujahideen are trying to avoid any harm to Kunduz residents,\" he said on his official Twitter account, referring to Taliban fighters.\n\nThe once-quiet north of Afghanistan has seen escalating violence in recent years. Kunduz city was the centre of fierce fighting in April as the Taliban sought to gain territory after the end of NATO's combat mission at the end of 2014.\n\nA scaled-down NATO presence now mostly trains and advises Afghan forces, although U.S. drones still target militant leaders and a U.S. counter-terrorist force also operates in the country.\n\n(Additional reporting by Mirwais Harooni, Jessica Donati, Hamid Shalizi.; Writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by Mike Collett-White, Nick Macfie, Robert Birsel)","title":"Afghan Taliban seize northern city centre in major attack","media-type":"News","source":"Yahoo!

AB InBev, the world's largest beer company with brands like Budweiser and Bud Light, has made a concerted push over the last several years to catch up with American consumers, who increasingly are trading mild-flavored lagers like Bud Light for more flavorful India Pale Ales and porters made by craft breweries. \n\nGolden Road road is the largest craft brewery in Los Angeles. Its beers include Point the Way IPA, Wolf Among Weeds IPA, Golden Road Hefeweizen and a collection of seasonal brews. The company, which sells both canned and draft beers, expects to sell 45,000 barrels of beer this year. \n\nThe acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of the year. \n\nThe deal is AB InBev's fifth craft-brewery acquisition since 2011. AB InBev bought its first craft brewer in 2011, paying $38.8 million for Chicago-based Goose Island. It has also picked up Patchogue, N.Y.-based Blue Point Brewing Co., Bend, Ore.-based 10 Barrel, and Seattle-based Elysian Brewing Co. \n\nThe Golden Road acquisition will give AB InBev a foothold in the growing Los Angeles craft beer market. Golden Road sold approximately 45,000 barrels of beer in 2015. Recent brewery acquisitions have priced craft brewers at more than $1,000 a barrel. Craft's share of the U.S. beer market has more than doubled over the past decade to 9%, while share for mainstream beers like Budweiser and Miller Lite have fallen to 77% from 86%, according to industry tracker Beer Marketer's Insights. Imported beer makes up the rest of the market. \n\nThe Golden Road deal is the third craft deal this month. MillerCoors LLC, a joint venture between SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Co., recently announced a deal for San Diego-based Saint Archer. Dutch Brewer Heineken NV said earlier this month it took a 50% stake in Lagunitas Brewing, the sixth-largest independent brewer in the U.S. \n\nThe deal comes as AB InBev pursues beverage-maker SABMiller PLC, a bold move that, if successful, would create a brewing giant that would dominate much of the global beer market. \n\nA deal would allow the new beer behemoth to take big mainstream brands like Budweiser and Stella Artois, which have been languishing in key markets, into new corners of the globe. The deal could also help the two brewers resist the growing popularity of craft beers. \n\nSABMiller has said that its board \"will review and respond as appropriate to any proposal which might be made.\" \n\nWrite to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com Access Investor Kit for \"AB InBev\"\n\nVisit http:\/\/www.companyspotlight.com\/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=BE0003793107\n\nAccess Investor Kit for \"AB InBev\"\n\nVisit http:\/\/www.companyspotlight.com\/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US03524A1088\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http:\/\/online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 23, 2015 13:45 ET (17:45 GMT)","title":"Anheuser-Busch to Buy Craft Brewer","media-type":"News","source":"ADVFN UK","published":"2015-09-23T18:05:13Z"}

Recent policy approaches have targeted significant reduction of these emissions to combat climate change in the US. \n \nThe study found that as against 122 million tons of garbage estimated to have been dumped in 2012 by the EPA, there was around 262 million tons of garbage dumped in landfills that year, the environmental scientists wrote. \n \n\"This suggested that methane emissions, from the decomposition of municipal waste at these dumps, was also undercounted,\" the report states. \n \nThe scientists claimed to have used a different methodology which was the \"most accurate for the US so far\" than the EPA. \n \nThe efficacy of active gas collection systems in the US was also examined by the scientists by analyzing performance data, including fire occurrence, from more than 850 landfills. \n \nThe study's primary goal was to learn more about the efficiency of methane capture systems at landfills, which are more effective after a landfill stops accepting new waste, said study co-author Jon T. Powell, a Yale doctoral student. \n \n\"When a landfill reaches the end of its life, an engineered cap or barrier system is installed to seal off the waste material from the environment,\" Powell said. \n \n\"Open landfills typically have some areas that are 'closed' in this manner, but also have areas that do not have permanent caps, and it is more difficult to extract methane and other gases that are generated in these areas.\" \n \nThe study found that gas collection systems at closed landfills were significantly more efficient and on average 17 percentage points more efficient than those at open landfills, but open landfills were found to represent 91 percent of all landfill methane emissions. \"These results demonstrate the clear need to target open landfills to achieve significant near-term methane emission reductions,\" states the report. \n \nLandfills represent the third-largest, man-made source of methane in the United States -- about 18 percent of domestic emissions, according to the report. \n \nMethane lives for a shorter time in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), the most abundant greenhouse gas (GHG), but traps far more of the heat radiated from Earth's surface. \n \nThe scientists calculated that the average rate of landfill waste disposal was increasing at a rate of about 0.3 percent per year. \n \nThe underestimation of the waste disposal and the emission in the United States has raised the spectre of similar miscalculations in the rest of the world. \n \n\"A high reliance on land filling has been observed in the EU (European Union) and in developing nations, similar to the US,\" wrote the researchers. \n \n\"Improving the collection of LFG at open landfills, must be a target for policymakers, researchers and practitioners to achieve near-term GHG emission reductions in the waste sector.\"","title":"GHG emission from US landfills underestimated, finds new report","media-type":"News","source":"BostonNews.Net","published":"2015-09-21T23:59:56Z"}

{"id":"0c78625e-4eca-4f46-ad11-45f85ea1e7f9","content":"Old River Baptist Church on FM 1409, just over the county line into Chambers County, held a dinner Saturday evening, Sept. 26, to hear from representatives of Operation Christmas Child. \n  \nAmong the representatives was Alex Nsengimana, a survivor of the tribal war and attempted genocide in Rwanda during the mid-1990s, whose life was brightened once as a 7-year-old orphan when he received a shoebox filled with school supplies, candy and other items sent to his orphanage from Operation Christmas Child. It was the first present he had ever gotten. \n \nPastor Mark Brumbelow of tiny Grace Baptist Church in Brazoria, Texas, also spoke Saturday evening. He described the success his 25 to 30-member congregation has had over the past 10 years packing and shipping shoeboxes full of the things small children might want or need. With the local CATO store saving boxes for them, his congregation filled 43 shoeboxes in 2013. The next year, believing the Almighty was leading him to do so, Brumbelow set for his church the goal of filling and shipping 500 shoeboxes in 2014. He said they exceeded their goal and shipped 536 boxes last year. Shipping costs $7 per box, so $3,500 were needed to ship 500 boxes, but as collection week neared and money was short, Brumbelow said, unexpected donations came in, including a $1,000 donation from a visitor to his church. \n \nBrumbelow said his church\u2019s goal for this year is to pack and ship 2,000 shoeboxes, and they have 1,004 boxes packed so far. \n \nNsengimana began his speech by saying that while telling his story, he did not want the audience to hear it as only his story. \u201cI pray that you can see yourself in it,\u201d he told the audience, and see what God can do in their lives. \n \n\u201cI was born and raised in a very tiny little country called Rwanda,\u201d he said, \u201cYou can fit maybe 20 Rwanda in Texas, that\u2019s how small it is.\u201d \n \n\u201cIn the 1800s we were colonized by Belgium and Germany. While we were colonized they divided Rwanda into three tribes\u201d\u2014 the Tutsi, the Hutu, and the Twa. \n \nA revolutionary movement took place in 1959 and many members of Nsengimana\u2019s tribe, the Tutsi, fled the country that was afterwards dominated by the Hutu majority. \n \nCivil war erupted several times, most recently in 1990, and in 1994 the Hutu controlled army and militia attempted to exterminate the Tutsi. \n \n\u201cAs a little boy I was raised by my grandmother who would take me to church, and I loved her very much,\u201d Nsengimana said. \u201cMy family was part of the Tutsi tribe, and through the years my grandmother faced a lot of hostility.\u201d \n \nWhen Nsengimana was then 6 years old, he said the militia came to his village on April 17, 1994 and killed his grandmother. He and his brother were taken in by an aunt and uncle, but the militia returned later searching for his uncle. \n \nAfter this he was cared for by another aunt and uncle in the city, but shortly after the war his uncle passed away and his aunt also became ill. Unable to care for him and his brother, Nsengimana\u2019s aunt placed them in a crowded orphanage, and it was there that he received the package from Operation Christmas Child. \n \nAmong the miracles Nsengimana said he experienced as a small child, he described a gunman\u2019s magazine dropping out of his rifle just before he would have fired on Nsengimana and other children. He also described running from gunfire and slipping on a cow pie and falling just as he heard a bullet whiz over his head. \n \nLater, as a teenager Nsengimana had the opportunity to come to the United States, and while attending high school in the U.S. became involved with Operation Christmas Child. \n \nOperation Christmas Child is a project of Samaritan\u2019s Purse, and according to information provided by them, Samaritan\u2019s Purse \u201cis a nondenominational evangelical Christian organization providing spiritual and physical aid to hurting people around the world\u201d that has operated since 1970. Operation Christmas Child asks volunteers pack each shoebox with one nice toy \u2014 such as a doll, a stuffed animal or a soccer ball (with pump) \u2014 along with other toys, hygiene items and school supplies. Boxes are collected in mid-November to be delivered by Christmas. \n \nFranklin Graham, son of Billy Graham, is chairman of the board, president and CEO of Samaritan\u2019s Purse.","title":"Rwandan survivor promotes Operation Christmas Child at Old River Baptist Church","media-type":"News","source":"Cleveland Advocate","published":"2015-09-28T18:48:37Z"}

The news was first reported by The Des Moines Register. \n \n\"What we've looked at and come around to is similar thoughts as in 2011,\" said Bruce Rastetter, a major GOP donor who made his fortune in the pork and ethanol industries. \"We need blunt, bold leadership. We need somebody that can actually govern.\" \n \nOf the seven who hopped aboard the private plane to the East coast in 2011, two have long been vocal supporters and one has said he would not endorse because he works for an elected official. Getting the majority to publicly endorse Christie is a boon for his campaign. He has struggled to compete in a crowded field that includes attention-grabbing front-runner Donald Trump. \n \n\"Whatever he needs, we're going to be behind him,\" said real estate developer Gary Kirke, who said the group wanted to stick together. \n \nHis backers think his chances are improving after strong debate performances and with two governors \u2014 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry \u2014now out of the race. Now Rastetter said he hopes the endorsements will send a message to Iowa Republicans, that they should \"give him another look.\" \n \nChristie held a town hall meeting with Rastetter Monday night, telling the crowd gathered in a cavernous barn that \"you'll always know how hard I'm willing to fight for you.\" He declined to talk about the endorsements in advance of the Tuesday press conference. \n \nThe trip this week marks his ninth to the leadoff caucus state this year. Christie, who has focused more heavily on New Hampshire, has spent less time here than many other contenders, though he put in a marathon day at the Iowa State Fair in August and has a well-regarded team, with respected operatives Phil Valenziano and Jeffrey Boeyink. \n \nCampaign aides said Christie will be ramping up his visits to the state in the fall. Mikel Derby, who works for the state's transportation department and who was part of the Christie recruitment effort in 2011, said there is still time for Christie to do well. \n \n\"History is littered with the Bachmanns and Walkers who are superstars real early. There's no purpose in peaking in August and September,\" said Derby, who has been with Christie all along. \n \nStill, while these endorsements matter, most agree Christie will still have to invest more time in Iowa. Republican State Rep. Chip Baltimore, who has not endorsed a candidate, said there was no substitute for retail politicking. \n \n\"If he is not here, he will not do well,\" Baltimore said. \"Gov. Christie, when he talks to people and meets people, is very persuasive. People walk away from that generally feeling positive toward him.\"","title":"Iowans who sought to draft Christie in 2011 are with him for 2016","media-type":"News","source":"Minneapolis Star Tribune","published":"2015-09-29T04:05:15Z"}

{"id":"d8ec5d11-bf4d-4464-8dc7-c0984563181b","content":"FOX LAKE, Ill. \u2014 Authorities broadened the hunt Wednesday for three suspects wanted in the fatal shooting of a popular Illinois police officer, even as they acknowledged that they had no indication the men were still in the area where the slaying happened. \n \nAfter an intensive 14-hour \u201cgrid search\u201d of homes, railroad tracks and marshland in the village of Fox Lake, the second-day manhunt turned to the painstaking detective work of chasing down tips, collecting and reviewing surveillance video and interviewing residents near the crime scene. Meanwhile, new search teams rippled out into subdivisions beyond the initial 2-square-mile perimeter established on Tuesday. At least 100 investigators were on the ground. \n \nA major challenge was the lack of a description of the suspects beyond the vague one that came from the officer, who told dispatchers he was pursuing three suspicious men \u2014 two white, one black \u2014 moments before he was shot. \n \n\u201cThat was the only description provided,\u201d said Lake County Major Crimes Task Force Cmdr. George Filenko, the lead investigator on the case. \u201cSo of course we\u2019re getting the public calling in every time they see that match of three individuals or even two individuals. We\u2019ve closed out those leads completely as being unsubstantiated.\u201d \n \nLt. Charles Joseph Gliniewicz, a 30-year police veteran, was shot Tuesday morning while pursuing the men he spotted on his way to work, Filenko said. Gliniewicz told dispatchers the three ran into a swampy area, and he requested a second unit. \n \nDispatchers soon lost contact with him. Backup officers found him about 50 yards from his squad car with a gunshot wound. He died soon after. \n \nFilenko said there was no indication he was intentionally targeted, though authorities did not rule out that possibility. \n \nThe initial, frenzied search for his killers involved law enforcement agencies from across the state. Some wore tactical gear and toted high-powered rifles. Officers took up positions on rooftops and along railroad tracks and scanned the terrain through rifle scopes and binoculars. Others leaned out of helicopters with weapons at the ready. \n \nOn Tuesday night, they declared the initial search zone clear, allowing investigators to begin poring over the crime scene and surrounding area. \n \nStill, they knocked on doors with caution. \n \n\u201cI believe that the search teams did a thorough job, but I know there have been a number of national incidents where suspects have cleverly escaped or hidden in place,\u201d Filenko said. \u201cSo anything\u2019s possible.\u201d \n \nInvestigators were reviewing video recordings, but so far none has captured images of the suspects, Filenko said. \n \nDespite the challenges, he told reporters that he felt the teams were making progress. \n \n\u201cAs always, we\u2019re relying on the public, too,\u201d he said. \u201cAll it takes is one tip or good lead to break a case wide open.\u201d \n \nResidents of the usually sleepy community were urged to stay vigilant. Schools that went on lockdown the day of the shooting were closed a day later. \n \nAn emotional Mayor Donny Schmit described the slain officer as a personal friend and a father of four sons. \n \n\u201cWe lost a family member,\u201d Schmit said of the 52-year-old officer known around town as \u201cG.I. Joe.\u201d \u201dHis commitment to the people of this community has been unmatched and will be dearly missed.\u201d \n \nWorkers adorned the village hall with black and purple bunting in a display of mourning. Several evening vigils were planned. \n \nEleven-year-old Takoa Thomas, a sixth grader, stood on the side of a road with a handmade sign that read \u201cCops\u2019 lives matter. RIP GI Joe.\u201d \n \n\u201cI wanted to be out here to show support,\u201d the boy said. \n \nHis mother, Tara England, 41, said the boy\u2019s school was closed, and she had mixed feelings about their safety. \n \n\u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m out here is I don\u2019t want to be home alone,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband\u2019s at work.\u201d \n \n\u201cBut if it were me, I\u2019d be long gone,\u201d she said of the suspects. \n \nThe area near the Wisconsin border area is popular for boating and other outdoor pursuits because of its forest preserves and a chain of lakes that partly encircles Fox Lake. \n \nGliniewicz\u2019s death is the third law enforcement fatality in Illinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, which tracks officers\u2019 deaths so their names can be enshrined on a Washington, D.C., memorial. \n \nIt says police shooting deaths in the U.S. are down 13 percent this year compared with the same January-to-September period last year. There were 30 last year and 26 this year. \n \nAttorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the recent fatal shootings, telling a housing conference in Washington that violence against \u201call of us, regardless of what uniform any of us wear\u201d must end. \n \nLynch said it\u2019s a \u201csad fact now\u201d that no one is safe, citing shootings of churchgoers at a Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina, moviegoers in Louisiana, military personnel in Tennessee and two television journalists killed on the air last week in Virginia. \n  In Other News","title":"Hunt for 3 suspects widens after Illinois officer\u2019s death","media-type":"News","source":"San Francisco Examiner","published":"2015-09-03T02:21:10Z"}
{"id":"ef637742-6fff-4def-967c-86a5016e2a47","content":"When new federal regulations kick in this year to reduce power plant emissions, a statewide energy crisis could loom.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is calling for a 32 percent reduction by 2030. In order to get there, several coal plants across Michigan will begin to close this year.In all, nine plants are expected to close over the next two years, with nothing currently planned to replace the energy they produce.Two units at the Trenton Channel Power Plant are among those that will close, along with two more south of the Downriver area at the J.R. Whiting plant near Luna Pier.DTE spokeswoman Randi Berris told The News-Herald Newspapers last year that the decision to close the units was a direct result of the new EPA regulations.\u201cThe decision was made because of new federal emissions' regulations taking effect in the next few years, and because of DTE\u2019s focus on reducing customers' rates and maintaining competitive electric rates in the future,\" Berris said.The Wyandotte Municipal Power Plant uses a combination of ways to generate power, coal burning among them. The plant wasn\u2019t on a shutdown list provided by the state of Michigan.No one from the plant was available to talk by press time for this report.Seven of the plants are owned by Consumers Energy and generate more than 950 megawatts of electricity. Overall, more than 1.3 daily gigawatts of power will need to be replaced after the plants all close.That amount would be enough to run Detroit, Grand Rapids and Lansing each day.Consumers Energy officials said they're doing their best to stretch resources to provide electricity to the state\u2019s residents. Those efforts include reopening a Dearborn power plant and the $155 million purchase of the Juniper power plant in Jackson.\"You can't store electricity, so it's important to try and have a surplus of it,\" John Russell, president and CEO of Jackson-based Consumers Energy, said in a statement. \"When customers hit the switch, they're either going to have it or they're not.\"Both political parties in the state have ideas on how to change regulations to help figure out the looming crisis.The GOP plan recently was released by Sen. Mike Nofs (R-Battle Creek), who chairs the state Senate Energy and Technology Committee.\u201cThis legislation represents hundreds of hours\u2019 worth of research, discussion and input from numerous individuals, groups and organizations, including the governor, committee members and the 37-member workgroup I appointed last year,\u201d Nofs said. \u201cThese bills represent a starting point for a thorough committee process that will ultimately help us craft the best policy to respond to a rapidly changing landscape for energy.\u201dThe Democrats' side is spearheaded by state Rep. Bill Lavoy (D-Monroe) and state Sen. Hoon-Young Hopgood (D-Taylor).\u201cThrough 2014, renewable energy projects have brought nearly $3 billion in investment to Michigan, and utilities are on track to meet the 10 percent goal required in current law,\u201d LaVoy said. \u201cAs long as renewable energy remains economically viable, the percentage of power generation should increase. Additionally, increasing Michigan-based generation keeps jobs and investment in Michigan.\u201dState Sen. David Knezek (D-Dearborn Heights) and state Rep. Julie Plawecki (D-Dearborn Heights) also are working on the Democratic side of the aisle.The two plans are quite different.Nofs' plan calls for revamping the current integrated resource planning process to change the way utility companies are evaluated. The Republican plan hasn\u2019t been well publicized since it officially was unveiled July 1.The Democratic plan has been on display and talked about since early March. It calls for an increase in support for clean energy-type businesses, with more focus on wind and solar energy companies.\u201cWe want to encourage companies to spend here in Michigan,\u201d Knezek said. \u201cRight now, there isn\u2019t anything that restricts out- of-state buying of power. We don\u2019t want that to remain unregulated.\u201dPlawecki echoed those thoughts. She said if Michigan encourages companies to produce energy within the state, it will increase jobs and ultimately help the local economy.Since Michigan passed a renewable energy bill in 2008, more than $5 billion a year have been pumped into the state economy. About $3 billion of that has been invested by private-sector firms.Small-business owners claim the GOP plan for energy production moving forward will put a stop to much of that growth.\u201cThe Nofs' plan slams the brakes on Michigan\u2019s clean energy sector, which has been a huge success, supporting 20,500 jobs and $5 billion in annual economic activity,\u201d Mark Cryderman, business development\/education manager of the Green Panel, said in a statement. \u201cPolling consistently shows overwhelming support for increasing Michigan\u2019s use of clean energy and the Michigan Legislature should be increasing our clean energy standards, not repealing them.\u201dThe Green Panel is a Brighton-based solar company that employs 30 people.State Rep. Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Twp.), who co-authored much of the GOP plan, is against the changes at the federal level, but said he believes its plan is the best bet for the state.\u201cThe mandate that is being forced upon Michigan and the rest of the states by the federal government is an unprecedented overreach that will hinder job growth and raise energy rates on hardworking taxpayers,\" Nesbitt said in a statement. \u201cWe need an energy plan for the future that ensures reliability and efficiency, while being cost-effective for Michigan families.\u201cThe energy proposal I unveiled earlier this year is structured to take an \u2018all of the above\u2019 approach that considers each of those elements, rather than a narrow, cookie-cutter approach that picks winners and losers.\u201dHopgood believes the Democrats' plan is the way to go, both for clean energy and economic growth in the state.\u201cThis plan is pro-business, pro-consumer and pro-environment,\" he said. \"Michigan has the potential to be a leader in renewable energy and create thousands of jobs for hardworking men and women across the state. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial that we act this year. With these energy principles, my Democratic colleagues and I are ready to get to work.\u201dThere is overwhelming public support for increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency, according to a poll conducted by the Michigan Conservative Energy Forum in late 2013. Among the findings, the poll showed that more than 75 percent strongly support an increased renewable portfolio standard and 84 percent support more energy efficiency programs. The support extended to self-identified conservative voters.\u201cWith such strong public support from both ends of the political spectrum, it\u2019s clear that this plan is the right way forward for Michigan\u2019s energy sector and our economy,\u201d LaVoy said. \u201cI look forward to working with my Republican colleagues to put these guidelines into action and create jobs while saving residents' money.\u201dAccording to a report from The Hill Group, a renewable portfolio standard increase would generate as much as $6 billion in economic activity and create tens of thousands of jobs. The Michigan Public Service Commission noted that in 2012 every dollar utilities spent on energy efficiency saved consumers an estimated $3.83 in reduced energy costs.","title":"Opinions differ on how to move forward with new energy regulations; residents could be left in the dark","media-type":"News","source":"Heritage News-Herald","published":"2015-08-14T20:53:52Z"}

{"id":"2c04a5fc-b431-44b5-85a1-9ace3c5d00c7","content":"With almost a century of caps to his name, Sean Lamont is the old dog of Scottish rugby who believes he has learned enough tricks to keep on barking. \n \nBut the Glasgow Warrior insists he will be worried if he is not chased out of the side by one of the Dark Blues' young pups. \n \nThe 34-year-old made his 96th appearance for his country in Saturday's Test against Italy, scoring two tries in the 48-7 Murrayfield rout. \n \nIt was one step closer to that elusive third figure that will make him just the second Scot after Chris Paterson to have collected 100 caps. \n \nBut while some may view this year's World Cup in England as a perfect opportunity for Lamont to bow out on a high - especially coming just four months after lifting the first major honour of a 15-year professional career with Glasgow's Guinness PRO12 triumph - the Perth-born back insists he is not interested in exit strategies. \n \nIn fact, he even wryly joked about the prospect of playing on until the next tournament in Japan in four years' time. \n \nBut that is only if he is not hounded out by the young pretenders. \n \n\"I will never retire,\" said\u00a0Lamont. \"I've got a contract with Glasgow for next year, but I think I'll ask to go again once it ends. \n \n\"The desire is still there, the body is holding out and, provided I'm wanted, I will keep going. \n   Five classic Rugby World Cup Matches    \n\"So I have no plans to call it a day after this World Cup. Could I keep going until the next one in 2019? Well if I was still playing by then I'd be worried. \n \n\"I'd be asking myself, 'Where the hell are all the young wingers?' \n \n\"I'd be over the moon if I was still around this team by 2019, but I hope to God there is someone coming along to take my place. \n \n\"We've got the likes of Damien Hoyland, Rory Hughes and Dougie Fife coming through, so there are plenty of boys about. \n \n\"But I won't retire. Someone will retire me, but it won't be my decision.\" \n \nLamont has been to the last two World Cups but, while the tournament is the pinnacle for many, his memories are only filled with regret. \n \nIn 2007 the Scots looked set for a semi-final slot until Argentina robbed them of the chance. \n \nThe Pumas then roared louder again four years later as Andy Robinson's side failed to even make it out of their group. \n \nThe Scots are now gearing up for crucial clashes with Japan, America, South Africa and Samoa in Pool B, and Lamont wants his team to learn from the mistakes of the past. \n \nHe said: \"Both my previous World Cup experiences were a bit of a disappointment, if I'm being frankly honest. \n \n\"I loved going and it was great to be part of it. But in 2007 we blew the chance to make a semi-final, which would have been incredible. \n \n\"We should have beat Argentina in the quarters. We played all the rugby but didn't see out the win. That's why it was such a pain in the bum. \n \n\"Then last time around we didn't even make it out the group, which was disgraceful. \n \n\"The alarm bells were ringing in the first two games against Romania and Georgia when we struggled against both. We then had the Argentina game all but wrapped up and a 30-second lapse of concentration cost us the game. \n \n\"That left us having to beat a tough England side by 14 points, which was a big ask at any time, never mind in a World Cup. \n \n\"So I'm acutely aware of the fact that every pool game we play has got to be top notch. \n \n\"We can't just focus on South Africa in the third game as the important one. We're not that good. We're good, but just look at the defeat to Tonga in Aberdeen a couple of years ago. That could happen again if we don't go in with the right attitude.\"","title":"Scotland Rugby World Cup preview: Lamont\u2019s desire still burning strong","media-type":"News","source":"London Evening Standard","published":"2015-09-06T14:50:45Z"}

This compares to a deficit of 4.3 percent of GDP for the same period in 2014. \n \nThe total revenue and grants for the period was 11.2 percent of GDP, against a target of 10.6 percent of GDP. \n \nIn nominal terms, the outturn was 5.4 percent higher than target and 32.9 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. \n \nGhana\u2019s good performance in total revenue and grants was mainly due to a strong growth in domestic revenue. \n \nTax income \n \nTax revenue amounted to GH\u00a211,403.9 million, 8.4 percent higher than the Budget target of GH\u00a210,516.3 million. \n \nIn nominal terms tax revenue was 32.1 percent higher than the outturn recorded for the same period in 2014. \n \nThe strong performance in tax revenue was mainly due to the good performance of petroleum taxes, VAT and trade taxes resulting from the imposition of the Special Petroleum Tax and exchange rate depreciation as well as improved revenue administration and efficiency. \n \nGDP estimates for first half of 2015 \n \nTotal expenditure, including payments for the clearance of arrears for the first half of 2015 amounted to GH\u00a218,068.5 million (13.5 percent of GDP) against a target of GH\u00a218,805.7 million (equivalent to 14.0 percent of GDP). \n \nThe outturn was 3.9 percent lower than the budget target but 14.1 percent higher than the outturn for the same period in 2014. \n \nThe growth in expenditure was mainly due to higher spending on goods and services and foreign financed capital expenditure. \n \nThe cash fiscal deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP for the period under review was financed mainly from domestic sources, resulting in a Net Domestic Financing (NDF) of the budget of GH\u00a21. 875.4 million (1.4 percent of GDP). \n \nThe NDF for the period was 57.3 percent lower than the budget target of GH\u00a24,395.1 million and 48.6 percent lower than the outturn for the same period in 2014. \n \nForeign Financing of the budget was GH\u00a21,218.0 million representing 39.4 percent of total financing, against a target of GH\u00a2206.1 million. \n \nThus domestic financing constituted about 60.6 percent of the total financing of the deficit for the first six months of the year.","title":"Reduce your expenditure or face our wrath \u2013 government tells assemblies","media-type":"News","source":"Spy Ghana","published":"2015-09-07T15:04:13Z"}

The city of Dayton has requested that Maple Grove pass a resolution supporting the need and the application. \n\nStaff said, \u201cWith the number of high profile transportation projects underway the city of Maple Grove is fortunate to complete some of our highest priorities. One of our remaining projects, the extension of Hwy. 610, still seeks funding and could benefit from TED funds in the future.

There would be signage in the patio area stating that alcohol containers are to remain in the patio area. The patio would have additional tables, seating, bathroom facilities and trash containers. \n\nThe council approved an amendment to OMNI Brewing Company to extend their current on-sale brewer\u2019s taproom\/Sunday sale and brewer off sale intoxicating- small brewer license to include alcohol service for an outdoor patio. \n\nPHOTOGRAPHY CONTEST  \n\nThe council also recognized the winners in the annual Maple Grove Moments Photography Contest. \n\nYouth Recognition category winners each received $50.

With thousands of treatment facilities in the country, it can be difficult to make a particular drug rehabilitation center stand out from the rest. Content marketing is \u201cthe strategy\u201d that can create critical visibility for the treatment facilities. \nWHY IS CONTENT KING? \n\nDrug and alcohol treatment is a highly personal process. Finding a treatment facility that the potential patient feels they can trust is a sensitive task. Having the right content on the treatment facility\u2019s website can help alleviate confusion and establish trust, rather than just having basic information about the facility such as location, phone number and services offered. Any facility can have a website; however, having a website that provides well-written information about treatment and addiction will give the reader insight When it comes to determining rank on search engines, Google loves to see relevant content from trusted sources drive traffic to a targeted site. \n   \nGoogle also loves to then see that traffic remain on your site. Consistently providing refreshing and relevant content will captivate a reader, not only encouraging them to go to your site but also keep them there. In the field of treatment, competition can be fierce. It is important to utilize content when demonstrating authority and pedigree in the field. In order to maintain a viable amount of patients, a treatment facility needs to have a good perception of all topics related to addiction and treatment. \n\nYour content can achieve even more authority when it is published by a highly trusted 3rd party source. Due to the fact that it can be difficult to constantly come up with new material for a website, having a professional writer create the content is most useful. Staying on top of developments in the treatment field will also make writing content easier. \n\nBlogs help make your content go viral and capture citations in the form of feedback and mentions. When the readers are actively talking about a topic, more keywords are being created, thus helping the treatment facility appear more often when those keywords are searched for. This creates more social authority and relevance for your content and ultimately boosts your website ranking. Any drug rehabilitation center can benefit from being talked about frequently. \n\nStaying fresh in reader\u2019s minds helps them to remember the facility when they decide to finally make the step towards treatment, or sending their loved one to treatment. In the end, content engages people and motivates them to act. Trusted publishing sources establishes pedigree, authority, drives traffic, and helps your website rank.

Here's how we rated the individual efforts. \n \n Colin Slade 6.5  \n \nProficient positioning at the back. Joined backline when he could and produced a couple of sweet passes. Got 11 minutes at first-five at start of second half before being subbed. \n \n Nehe Milner-Skudder 8  \n \nA big step up from nervous opener against the Pumas. Two tries made him the official man of the match. Some good steps and busted first tackle every time. Sweet hands to gift Codie Taylor the last try. \n \n Malakai Fekitoa 6  \n \nA mixed effort. Couple of nice touches to keep the ball alive. Quiet night with his own running game but showed right instincts to stay on Sonny Bill Williams' shoulder for a good try. Guilty of falling off the tackle that gave Namibia their try. \n \n Sonny Bill Williams 8  \n \nCarried on where he left off with his exciting cup opener. Showed his distribution is more than just offloads with some good wide passes. But pop-pass for Fekitoa's\u00a0 try was sublime and produced a beautiful flick off the ground to keep movement alive for Skudder's second try. \n \n Julian Savea 7  \n \nConfidence-booster for the big wing who finally broke his 2015 test try drought with a brace. Wasn't given a lot of space out wide but went looking for work constantly and was a danger on the inside channel. Couple of drops under the high ball contributed to a sloppy second spell by the All Blacks. \n \n Beauden Barrett 6.5  \n \nCompetent control at No 10. Showed blistering speed and eye for gap for his try. Good line kicking but guilty of over-doing chip kicks at times. Goalkicking still a concern with five out of nine attempts. \n \n TJ Perenara 5  \n \nHad an armchair ride behind a dominant pack. Content to move the ball with his passing and ignored his running game. Subbed after 47 minutes. \n \n READ MORE: \n* Recap: ABs earn scrappy win \n*\u00a0 Redemption for Milner-Skudder \n* Second stringers miss chance\u00a0 \n*\u00a0 ABs put nine tries past Namibia \n \n \n Victor Vito 8  \n \nThe pick of the pack. Looks comfortable at No 8 and showed good control at back of scrum. A lineout force and busy in all areas. Set the tone with his opening try and his game has real momentum at the moment. \n \n Same Cane 7  \n \nHandled the captaincy well, vocal and imploring his side to keep some shape against a committed opponent who were determined to slow the game down. Plenty of continuity play. Held the leadership when Richie McCaw was introduced for final quarter. \n    \n Jerome Kaino 6.5  \n \nSolid as ever. Wasn't a night of huge tackle counts as All Blacks dominated position but Kaino made his hits count. Subbed for McCaw after 61 minutes. \n \n Sam Whitelock 6.5  \n \nGot an early lineout steal and was good at the restarts \u2013 an area of concern in the All Blacks game lately but one where they got plenty of practice. \n \n Luke Romano 7.5  \n \nStrong display with his physical approach. Asked to go the distance and was still firing at the finish. Couple of bruising runs and effective cleanout work at breakdown. \n \n Charlie Faumuina 6.5  \n \nA pleasing hour's work by the tighthead who has been short of rugby over recent months. Anchored a dominant scrum and popped up around the fringes as well as doing the grind. \n \n RUGBY WORLD CUP ZONE: \n*\u00a0 RWC 2015 Match Centre \n*\u00a0 Tournament history \n*\u00a0 Best RWC moments \n*\u00a0 RWC team profiles \n*\u00a0 All Blacks squad \n*\u00a0 RWC Fantasy league \n*\u00a0 Printable wallchart  \n \n Codie Taylor 7  \n \nShowed the All Blacks have strength in the hooking department. Accurate lineout throwing and solid in the scrums. Popped up increasingly with his running and rewarded with the last try, looming out wide. \n \n Ben Franks 6.5  \n \nCost three points with an early penalty. Made up for that by scampering back to tidy up ugly situation in front of All Blacks' posts. Overpowered his opposite at scrum time. \n \n RESERVES  \n \n Keven Mealamu\u00a0 Not used \n \n Wyatt Crockett 6  \n \nGot on after 63 minutes and had a busy time amidst scrum resets. Knock-on when appearing in the backline. \n \n Tony Woodcock \u00a0 Not used \n \n Kieran Read 6  \n \nOn after 51 minutes for Sam Whitelock. Proved he's able to be locking cover in an area where the team are travelling light and looking for versatility. \n \n Richie McCaw 6  \n \nOn after 61 minutes for Kaino and took on blindside duties. Quiet time as game spluttered through frustrating final quarter. \n \n Tawera Kerr-Barlow 6  \n \nGot some much-needed game time in the black jersey with his last test almost a year ago. Content to be the link and produced a good option with a blindside pass for Savea's second try. \n \n Ma'a Nonu 6  \n \nOn after 61 minutes for Williams to notch his 99th\u00a0test.

But last year, when Gini was calculated for metro areas, Seattle didn\u2019t make the top 10. Those included Bridgeport, Conn.; Naples, Fla., New York; Miami, and Port St. Lucie, Fla. \n \nThe Wall Street Journal crunched Census data and came up with slightly different rankings . Still, Seattle didn\u2019t make the top 30 metropolitan areas in income inequality (nor the 30 least unequal, although Olympia did). \n \nThat doesn\u2019t mean all is well, of course. A new report from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at the so-called 90-10 ratio. In other words, the ratio of the 90th percentile in income to the 10th percentile. Thus,\u00a0the best paid 10 percent of wage earners in the country (the 90th percentile) earned at least $88,330 annually, while the lowest paid 10 percent (the 10th percentile) earned less than $18,190. \n   \nThe data cover 2003 to 2013, and not surprisingly location, metro size and occupation concentration make a big difference. \n Most Read Stories Fatal crash involving stolen motorcycle snarls I-5 traffic Rare fish landed off Westport could be new state record Car strikes, kills toddler in stroller in Bellevue Seahawks 26, Bears 0: What the national media are saying Father of Marysville shooter convicted of gun charges Unlimited Digital Access.  $1 for 4 weeks. \nThe report states, \u201cLarger areas, especially in the Northeast and on the West Coast, typically have greater wage inequality, while smaller areas, many of which are in the South and Midwest, have less inequality. Metropolitan areas with high concentrations of employment in higher paying occupations also tend to have greater inequality.\u201d \n \nThe ratio for Seattle-Bellevue-Everett was 5.21 in 2013.

The last time I played for the Warriors, most of us were coming from off-season and that could have contributed to the jittery performance. However, I\u2019m not bitter at all that the coaches have overlooked me because I understand the coach (Callisto Pasuwa) has his plans and the guys called are capable of getting the country the much needed positive result. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be back in the national team and will continue working hard,\u201d said Nakamba. \n \nThe 21-year-old former Njube High School pupil said he would continue training at his base during the Fifa calendar weekend break. \n \nPasuwa named what appears on paper to be a strong side, but his preparations for weekend game against Guinea took off at a snail\u2019s pace as most foreign-based players are stuck at their bases waiting for Zifa to send them air tickets. \n \nMidfielders who will do duty this weekend include the South African-based trio of Willard Katsande, Khama Billiat and Kuda Mahachi. \n \nOf the three, only Mahachi, who was not registered by Mamelodi Sundowns, has not played competitive football in the last four weeks, but has only been training with the Chloorkop side. \n \nMahachi\u2019s stellar performance against South Africa last month in Pietermaritzburg during the Under-23 Caf Championships clash, could be the reason the ginger-haired midfielder was called up. \n \nDanish-based midfielder Quincy Antipas has been ruled out and replaced by Dynamos\u2019 Ronald Chitiyo. \n \nChicken Inn\u2019s captain Danny \u201cDeco\u201d Phiri is the other locally-based midfielder called up for national duty.","title":"Nakamba overlooked","media-type":"News","source":"Zimbabwe Chronicle","published":"2015-09-01T22:01:52Z"}

He wins at the time you need it the most, with four of his seven victories for Toronto coming after losses. He dominates virtually every time he steps on the mound. And he takes that ball, and hangs onto it, deep into games, year after year.\n\nPrice, with 208 1\/3 innings, has eclipsed 200 innings in five of his six full seasons, making at least 31 starts a year.\n\nThe man will be paid, more than any free-agent starter in baseball this winter, with a payday that surely will surpass $200 million.\n\nIf you\u2019re the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees and Blue Jays, how can you not be salivating over the thought of having him in your rotation for the next seven years?\n\nConsidering the way he\u2019s dominating the American League, can you just imagine what he\u2019d do in the pitching-friendly National League with no DH and weaker lineups?\n\nPrice wisely won\u2019t divulge any preference for his next home, but considering the way he raves about the Cardinals\u2019 organization and its fan base, and living a five-hour drive away in Nashville, it\u2019s no secret that the Cardinals would have an advantage.\n\nSure, the Cardinals are leading the National League in ERA without him, but with Adam Wainwright on the DL and no real ace to carry them this postseason, they may realize just how badly they could use him in October.\n\nCan you imagine a rotation of Price, Wainwright, Michael Wacha, Lance Lynn and Carlos Martinez in 2016?\n\nOr if you\u2019re the Cubs, how about Jake Arrieta, Jon Lester and Price sitting atop the rotation? Price can also expect significant interest from San Francisco and Boston, where the Giants and Red Sox look to re-tool in modest to significant fashions.\n\nThe greatest thing that happened to all of the free-agent suitors for Price is that he was not traded in July to the Dodgers. If he gone to Los Angeles, he might have easily fallen in love with the place, just as Zack Greinke has done, giving the Dodgers the upper hand.\n\nGreinke will opt out of his contract after the season, but considering how much he enjoys everything but the traffic in Los Angeles, he\u2019s expected to return, only with a fatter bank account.\n\nIf the Dodgers want to go for the kill, they could conceivably have Clayton Kershaw, Greinke and Price all in the same rotation, giving them the most powerful starting trio since the Hall of Fame triumvirate of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz in Atlanta.\n\nIf you already have a $307 million payroll, what\u2019s another $30 million salary on the books?\n\nPrice, widely regarded as one of baseball\u2019s ultimate teammates and role models, won\u2019t bother thinking about free agency until November.\n\nFor now, he\u2019s got a division, pennant and World Series to win, and if he keeps pitching like this, will have the world at his feet.\n\nAnd the 2015 Cy Young award in his trophy case.\n\nPrice isn\u2019t just out there pitching for stats or a paycheck, he\u2019s helping carry the Blue Jays\u2019 down the stretch, going 7-1 with a 2.17 ERA in nine starts since his arrival, all in meaningful and impactful games.\n\nIt\u2019s this continuing dominance, and Keuchel\u2019s horrid outing Wednesday night when he gave up nine earned runs and three homers in 4 2\/3 innings, with his ERA soaring 15.3% from 2.22 to 2.56, that tips the scales to Price\u2019s favor. Sure, it may be unfair, considering that Keuchel has been brilliant all year, leading the league with 17 victories (to Price\u2019s 16) and innings (211.1 to Price\u2019s 208.1), while pitching at least six innings in every start and yielding two or fewer runs in 18 starts.\n\nYet, this is September, in the middle of playoff races, when everything is magnified.\n\nAnd please, no one else should be in the AL Cy Young conversation.\n\nSonny Gray (13-7, 2.56 ERA) of the Oakland A\u2019s is having a splendid year, but not as strong as Price and Keuchel, who are pitching in pressure-packed games. Chris Archer (12-12, 2.69 ERA) of the Tampa Bay Rays, who has 241 strikeouts, is a top five Cy Young candidate, but also falls short.\n\nPrice is poised to join Kershaw, Greinke and Tim Lincecum as the only active pitchers with multiple Cy Young awards on their resumes.\n\nHe could potentially have a Cy Young award and World Series trophy in six weeks, and by the holidays, could be guaranteed at least $200 million, setting up future generations of his family.\n\nSometimes, nice guys really can finish first.\n\nGALLERY: MLB postseason matchups, as they stand","title":"Why the Cy Young Award is David Price's to lose","media-type":"News","source":"USA Today","published":"2015-09-17T15:56:16Z"}

This included husbands and wives whose spouses died.\u00a0 \n\nThe redress is expected to run into millions of euros for those hit. According to estimates by specialist solicitors Spanish Legal Reclaims after analysing government data, around 30,000 paid tax in the three-year period. \n   \nUnfair tax: Those who faced an IHT bill on their Spanish holiday home during 2011-14 are entitled to compensation. Pictured, Andalucia in southern Spain \n\nThe tax charge was in many cases up to a third of the property's value and it varied between regions. \n\nIt can only be reclaimed by EU citizens after the Spanish government hastily changed its IHT law after the European Court of Justice ruled the legislation - which exempted residents from the charge - was discriminatory. \n\nThe ruling was made last September but it is believed thousands still haven't got the ball rolling with compensation - despite there being a five year limit to put a claim in.\u00a0 \n \nClaims typically take between six to eight months to process once they've been filed and the first glut of compensation is now being paid out. \n\nUnder the law, between 2011 and 2014 Spanish residents were exempt from up to 99 per cent of the tax charge depending on region, while homeowners with a property there had to pay the full amount within six months of inheriting. \n\nWith more Britons owning holiday homes in the sun in Spain than any other nationality, UK citizens were disproportionately affected. \n\nThey include Joan Ridsdale, a 62-year-old payroll administrator from County Durham who was hit with a \u20ac16,000 tax bill when her husband Gordon died. The couple owned a two-bedroom bungalow in the coastal resort of Almeria. \n\nMrs Ridsdale was forced to cash in her life savings to pay the charge and has since sold the property. \n\nThe Spanish authorities are now being forced to repay the inheritance tax paid by non-residents like Mrs Ridsdale. \n\nShe was one of the first to receive compensation from the Government earlier in the year. \n\nThe average repayment is \u20ac25,000, according to Spanish Legal Reclaims, a Barcelona-based law firm which specialises in helping non-residents to reclaim overpaid tax. \n   \nEU ruling: Last year, EU said the Spanish Government had acted unfairly - and people can claim redress \n\nLuis Cuervo, chief executive of Spanish Legal Reclaims, said: 'Losing a loved one is hard enough, but to then receive an unfair tax bill rubs salt in the wound. Yet for years this is what happened to thousands of Britons inheriting holiday homes in Spain. \n\n'Spain's authorities have agreed that non-residents who inherited a Spanish property during the past four-and-a-half years can claim back the tax they paid \u2013 but doing so is a complex and daunting task, as there is no single form to fill in. \n\n'Inheritors can only claim once, so it's essential they seek expert legal advice to ensure they get it right first time. \n\n'Spanish Legal Reclaims is representing 1,000 families from across the EU who find themselves in this position, and since the ECJ's landmark ruling our firm has had a 100 per cent success rate, securing a full refund of tax in every case.' \n\nBritons account for a substantial part of the law firm's business, it says.\u00a0 \n\nThe largest refund it secured for a British client was \u20ac94,000, the smallest \u20ac4,400. \n\nHowever, it takes a large 35 per cent chunk of any compensation on a 'no win, no fee' basis. \n\nMrs Ridsdale used the firm to handle her case \u2013 it secured a full refund of her \u20ac16,000 tax bill, plus \u20ac700 in back interest from the Spanish taxman.\u00a0 \n\nBut, with the fees, she was left with just under \u20ac11,000. \n\nThe firm says it is possible for British holiday homeowners to reclaim the tax themselves, but it is 'fiendishly difficult'. \n\nThey need to work out whether they can claim and then the process involves filling in multiple forms and making your case in court, which is all in Spanish.\u00a0 \n\nHomeowners only get one attempt to lodge a compensation bid. \n\n\u00a0","title":"Up to 30,000 Britons are eligible to claim compensation after Spanish government was forced to change 'unfair' inheritance tax laws on holiday homes","media-type":"News","source":"Mail Online UK","published":"2015-09-08T07:43:44Z"}
{"id":"37018d13-cbf8-428b-974c-b2e27177b224","content":"US spy chiefs can be blocked from accessing online data of European citizens, a court has ruled. \n \nIn what is being billed as a landmark decision, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) issued its opinion after Austrian campaigner Max Schrems challenged Facebook over the transfer of his personal information to American intelligence agencies. \n \nThe Luxembourg court found the Safe Harbor agreement between the US and Europe, which gives spies access to huge banks of data , does not stop watchdogs from investigating complaints or bar them from  suspending the transfers. \n \nThe arrangement allows the National Security Agency (NSA) to use the Prism surveillance system exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden to wade through billions of bits of personal data, communication and information held by nine internet giants . \n \nMr Schrems said the ruling could have  major implications for EU-US data flows and US internet companies operating in Europe. \n \n\"After an initial review of the advocate general's opinion of more than 40 pages it seems like years of work could pay off. Now we just have to hope that the judges of the Court of Justice will follow the advocate general's opinion in principle,\" he said. \n \nIn his opinion, which the ECJ said is not binding, Advocate General Yves Bot found that data transfers are an important and necessary element of the transatlantic relationship between the US and Europe. \n   Promoted stories   \nBut he warned that the European rules which govern it are invalid. \n \nIn one of the most damning findings, the ECJ said the access US spies have to European data interferes with the right to respect  for private life and protection of personal data. \n \nIt said internet users in Europe have no effective judicial protection while the large scale data transfers are happening. \n \nThe ECJ branded the US spying as \"mass, indiscriminate surveillance\". \n \nMr Schrems said that while his case was specific to Facebook it  may also apply to other tech giants like Apple, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. \n \nIn the 44-page opinion Mr Bot found: \"The access of the United States intelligence services to the data transferred covers, in a comprehensive manner, all persons using electronic communications services, without any requirement that the persons concerned represent a threat to national security. \n \n\"Such mass, indiscriminate surveillance is inherently disproportionate and constitutes an unwarranted interference with the rights guaranteed by Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter (of Fundamental Rights of the European Union).\" \n \nThe final ruling by the ECJ's 15 judges is expected later this year and while Mr Bot's opinion is not binding the court's final decision normally follows his initial assessment. \n \nMr Schrems, a Facebook user since 2008, first took his opposition to the Safe Harbor arrangement to the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) in Ireland - famously based in the unlikely setting of offices above a corner shop in the town of Portarlington. \n \nEveryone on the social network in the EU signs a contract with Facebook Ireland, audited by the DPC, and under the US-EU data transfer all their details can be accessed by the NSA. \n \nMr Schrems's challenge to seek an investigation into what data of his was sent to US spies will come back to the High Court in Dublin after the ECJ issues its final ruling. \n \nHis action was sparked by the Snowden revelations. \n \nThe former NSA contractor triggered a wave of controversy when he leaked tens of thousands of documents about surveillance programmes run by the US intelligence services and foreign counterparts, including Britain's GCHQ, in 2013. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nHe fled to Hong Kong where he met journalists to co-ordinate a series of articles that exposed mass surveillance programmes such as the NSA's Prism and GCHQ's Tempora, which involve \"hoovering up\" vast volumes of private communications. \n \nOnce Snowden's identity was revealed, he fled to Russia, and he remains wanted by the US authorities.","title":"US spies can be blocked from accessing Europeans' online data - court","media-type":"News","source":"Telegraph and Argus","published":"2015-09-23T10:08:48Z"}

Alicia White, argued on behalf of all six officers as the hearing began Thursday in Baltimore City Circuit Court. \n\nBates told Judge Barry Williams the settlement announced on Tuesday sends a message to prospective jurors that \"these officers are guilty, and if they are not guilty, why are we paying them $6.4 million?\" \n\nBates also says public comments by State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby make it impossible to find impartial jurors. He says she aligned herself with protesters, effectively convicting the officers before trial. \n\nGray died in April after suffering an injury in police custody. \n\nProsecutors will present arguments for why the trials should stay in Baltimore. \n\n--- \n\n9:45 a.m. \n\nSheriff's deputies have arrested a protester outside a Baltimore courthouse where a judge is to hear arguments about moving the trials of six city police officers charged in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray. \n\nShortly before the hearing was to begin at 9:30 a.m. Thursday in Baltimore Circuit Court, more deputies appeared outside the courthouse. Some had multiple plastic strips, used as handcuffs, clipped to their vests. \n\nDeputies formed a line and several surrounded one woman with a sign and a knapsack on the sidewalk in front of the courthouse. She had been the first demonstrator on the scene Thursday morning. Her sign said the trials should remain in Baltimore because, \"They didn't bother to kill him elsewhere.\" \n\nAfter deputies took her into the courthouse, her sign was behind a garbage can by the courthouse door. \n\n--- \n\n9:30 a.m. \n\nAbout 20 protesters have gathered in front of the downtown courthouse as a hearing starts for six officers charged in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray. \n\nThe hearing is over whether the officers' trials should be held in Baltimore or moved out of town. \n\nThe demonstrators chanted: \"It happened here. It has to stay here.\" Many of them were at the courthouse last week for a similar rally when a judge decided the six officers would be tried separately. \n\nThis time, with rain threatening, there weren't as many protesters at a morning rally. Police officers stood nearby in a line. \n\n--- \n\n9:10 a.m. \n\n\"Keep it here\" is the chant of demonstrators outside a Baltimore courthouse where a judge will hear arguments about the trial location for six police officers charged in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray. \n\nDefense attorneys have argued in pretrial motions that the officers can't get a fair and impartial trial in the city because of publicity about the case and because city residents were subject to a curfew in the spring after rioting broke out in the wake of Gray's April 19 death. \n\nThe Baltimore People's Power Assembly staged a small demonstration Thursday morning before the start of Thursday's pretrial hearing. Protesters carried signs saying, \"Black Lives Matter\" and seeking \"Jobs & Education, Not Police Terror.\" \n\n--- \n\n9 a.m. \n\nA judge is limiting the time for arguments in a pretrial hearing for six Baltimore police officers charged in connection with the death of Freddie Gray. \n\nEach side will get 15 minutes Thursday to make their arguments about where the trials should be held. \n\nCircuit Judge Barry Williams is hearing arguments on defense motions asserting the officers cannot get fair trials in Baltimore due heavy pretrial publicity and the effect on potential jurors of a citywide curfew after rioting in April. \n\nProsecutors say the trials should be held in Baltimore. \n\nGray was a 25-year-old black man who died in April, a week after suffering a critical spinal injury in police custody. \n\n--- \n\n8 a.m. \n\nThe first protester showed up around 8 a.m. Thursday outside Baltimore Circuit Court, where a pretrial hearing in the Freddie Gray case is planned. \n\nThe woman carried a sign urging that the trials of six city police officers charged in Gray's arrest and death remain in Baltimore. \n\n\"They didn't bother to kill him elsewhere,\" the sign read. \n\nJudge Barry Williams will hear arguments Thursday morning by attorneys for the officers to consider a change of venue. Defense attorneys have argued in court filings that pre-trial publicity means the officers can't fair and impartial trial in Baltimore. \n\nGray suffered a spinal injury during his arrest in April in West Baltimore and died a week later. \n\n--- \n\n6:45 a.m. \n\nA Baltimore pastor has been arrested a week after police say he blocked traffic while protesting during pre-trial hearings in the Freddie Gray case. \n\nPolice say they arrested 27-year-old Westley West on Wednesday after obtaining a warrant charging him with attempting to incite a riot, malicious destruction of property, disorderly conduct, disturbance of the peace, false imprisonment and failure to obey. \n\nOnline court records show West is charged with walking on a road where a sidewalk is provided, but don't list a lawyer. \n\nPolice say they recorded West, the pastor at Faith Empowered Ministries, stepping in front of a pickup truck and hitting the hood with his bullhorn. Others joined West blocking traffic, but fled when officers approached. \n\nThe arrest came a day before another pre-trial hearing for six officers charged in the death of Gray, a 25-year-old black man fatally injured in police custody.","title":"The Latest: Prosecutor wants a Baltimore jury in Gray case","media-type":"News","source":"Fresno Bee","published":"2015-09-10T14:43:12Z"}

A tiny alien creature that washed up on the banks of a river in north western Russia has locals and experts stumped.

The key word being 'mutant'.\n\nThe residents of the town, which is in the shadow of the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant, are \"naturally suspicious\" of expert authority, reported the Australian duo behind the Mysterious Universe podcast report, tongues-firmly-in-cheeks.\n\nThe plant had a history of disastrous industrial accidents and cover-ups, according to a former Russian Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety, Vladimir Kuznetsov.\n\nThree people were killed when a cooling circuit unit ruptured the year the plant opened in 1975. Over last three decades there have been two fires, a radiation spill detected six kilometres from the sight and five other major accidents at the plant.\n\nIf it is a radioactive mutant spawned from a leak at the nuclear power that makes Kesha more Blinky the fish than a flesh-eating alien.\n\nIt's not the first time reports of a bite-sized extra terrestrial corpse has captivated the imagination of Earthlings.\n\nPerhaps Kesha is a distant relative of Ata, the alien-like oddity discovered in a ghost town of the Atacama Desert of Chile in 2003.\n\nThe bizarre 12-centimetre-long skeleton was the star of the UFO documentary Sirius, and paraded as persuasive evidence of alien life.\n\nThat was until an immunologist had the novel idea that a rigorous scientific analysis of the specimen might hold the answers.\n\nAfter mapping more than 500 million reads to a reference human genome and examining x-rays of the humanoid, immunologist and director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Proteomics Centre for Systems Immunology at Stanford Garry Nolan proved Ata was of this world.\n\nAta was human. Possibly a 22-week-old foetus with a severe form of a rare rapid ageing disease, progeria, and died in the womb or after premature birth.\n\nWill the same extensive analysis be carried out to determine the origins of tiny Kesha? Scientists say it could take years.\n\nWho knows? Perhaps Kesha could become the first confirmed proof of alien humanoid life by the time President Trump takes up his second term in the White House.

{"id":"50898341-22dc-4fd9-9164-29f2bd7d4705","content":"BERLIN -- Crowds greet trainloads of migrants with applause, candy and toys. A provincial town's mayor wants to take in more refugees. Top conservative politicians say Germany needs young immigrants. \n \nIt's a contrast with a frosty reception when migrant arrivals in Germany last spiked in the 1990s and mainstream politicians rushed to tighten asylum rules, while the country's top-selling newspaper asked: \"The flood is rising - when will the boat sink?\" \n \nGermany expects 800,000 new migrants to arrive this year, nearly twice the previous record. And while attacks on homes for refugees and anti-migrant protests have caused widespread alarm, the broader atmosphere has been strikingly welcoming - illustrated by the weekend's euphoric scenes in stations from Bavarian metropolis Munich to provincial Saalfeld in which throngs of Germans greeted migrants. \n \nThe previous record dates back to 1992, when nearly 440,000 asylum-seekers came as the former Yugoslavia disintegrated - coinciding with a spate of anti-foreigner attacks that shamed Germany. \n \nIn perhaps the most notorious incident back then, days of rioting in the eastern city of Rostock saw far-right extremists throw firebombs and stones at a center for refugees, then a neighboring apartment block inhabited by Vietnamese immigrants, as bystanders cheered. \n \nIn contrast to the Bild daily's 1992 headline about a sinking boat, the newspaper today has taken a pro-refugee line. A recent Sunday edition led with seven pages of supportive messages from prominent Germans under the headline \"100 voices against hatred of refugees.\" \n \n\"We stood on the edge of a moral abyss ... and we have moved on as a society,\" said Christoph Rass, an expert on contemporary history at the University of Osnabrueck's Institute for Migration Research and Intercultural Studies. Previous generations of immigrants have found their place in society, Germany has become more prosperous and racism is no longer \"socially acceptable\" in the way it was back then, he said. \n \nOrdinary Germans have been pitching in lately to help refugees. Many went over the weekend to Munich's main station, bringing everything from water to toiletries, as trains with refugees arrived. On Sunday, police tweeted that no more donations were needed at the station, then called for people to donate men's clothing and shoes to a city refugee shelter. Within three hours, no more of those were needed either. \n \nChancellor Angela Merkel says she is \"proud and grateful to see how countless people in Germany are reacting to the arrival of the refugees.\" \n \nThese days, politicians stress that the boat isn't full - in fact, it threatens to get worryingly empty due to a demographic crisis brought on by a low birth rate. Increasingly, leaders portray the wave of migrants as an opportunity for Europe's biggest economy. As it stands, deaths outpace births, and the government's statistical office said earlier this year that it expects the population of 80.8 million to shrink by a tenth or more by 2060. \n \n\"We are a country of immigration. We need people. We need young people. We need immigrants,\" Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told visitors to a recent government open day event. \"All of you know that, because we have too few children.\" \n \nOliver Junk, the mayor of Goslar in central Germany, has drawn attention by saying that his town of 50,000 - with a dwindling population and empty housing - could take in more refugees. He argues that \"towns like Goslar have no chance without a long-term influx\" of people. \n \nDe Maiziere's description of Germany as a \"country of immigration\" would have been hard to imagine from a leading conservative politician only 15 years ago. \n \nA bitter 1999 state election campaign centered on a conservative drive against allowing dual citizenship for many residents with foreign roots. The following year, an unsuccessful candidate to be governor of Germany's most populous state used the slogan \"Kinder statt Inder,\" or \"children, not Indians\" to argue that Germany should step up its own education rather than bring in foreign computer experts. \n \nPoliticians' response to rising asylum applications in the 1990s was \"too many are coming, we'll solve the problem by limiting the right to asylum, then it's dealt with and everyone can sleep easy,\" said Orkan Kosemen, an expert on integration at the Bertelsmann Foundation think-tank. When refugee centers were attacked at the time, there were candlelight vigils and help campaigns but \"the majority was indifferent,\" he said. \n \nAn immigration law approved in 2004 sought to balance Germany's need to attract qualified migrants with concerns about matters such as their integration, mandating government-funded German language and civics courses for newcomers. \n \n\"Germany has changed mentally in the past 20 years,\" Kosemen said. Immigration has become a less polarizing issue and is no longer considered an exception as it was in the 1990s, he said. \n \nMerkel herself acknowledges that a large population of people with foreign roots has gradually changed Germany, and that the term \"guest workers\" stuck for too long as a term for Turks and others recruited by West Germany as the economy boomed in the 1960s. Many put down roots, and \"fortunately we have for some time come around to seeing that they are our fellow citizens, of whatever origin.\" \n \n\"The fact that the third or fourth generation is living with us has changed our country,\" she said. Then-President Christian Wulff declared in 2010 that Islam is part of Germany, and Merkel reiterated last week that \"of course it now belongs in Germany.\" \n \nOver recent years, even the World Cup-winning national soccer team has become a symbol of a more diverse Germany, with Merkel describing it as an example for the successful integration of immigrants, as ethnic Germans like Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Mueller played alongside stars such as Mesut Ozil, with Turkish roots, and Sami Khedira, whose father is Tunisian. \n \nStars from the national team have appeared in a video this week to promote tolerance, and leading soccer clubs have joined the effort to help. National champion Bayern Munich is organizing a training camp for migrant children, for example, and Mainz invited hundreds of migrants to its games. \n \nMeantime, many other Germans are doing what they can to pitch in to help migrants. \n \nIn Berlin, when film producer Gian-Piero Ringel heard that migrants were standing in long lines for days to register with authorities overwhelmed by the flood, he organized movie-set caterers to provide them with food and drinks. \n \nSonja Meyer, 26, a trainee teacher, said hundreds of migrants have arrived at a reception center in hear eastern Berlin neighborhood. A local group that helps refugees didn't need any more help, so she took toiletries and diapers to the refugees. \n \n\"Of course there are also people who are hostile and say they'll ruin our fences if they lean against them,\" she said. \"And I have a few friends who say poor Germans should be taken care of first, and I find that terrible. ... But most people are helping wonderfully. They are taking refugees into their apartments, offering them rooms and having barbecues for the refugees.\" \n \n___ \n \nKirsten Grieshaber contributed to this report.","title":"German refugee welcome contrasts with cold reception in '90s","media-type":"News","source":"Chicago Daily Herald","published":"2015-09-07T11:00:00Z"}

Rafael Fernandez with Metro police spoke to the church at Woodbine\u2019s Joy Club on Tuesday about the topic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to everybody about the bump and rob,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cHas everybody heard of the bump and rob?\u201d\n\nPolice said the bump and rob is when criminals purposely run into the back of a victim\u2019s car. When it\u2019s time to exchange information, the thieves then rob them and often take their car.\n\n\u201cAnother situation is where they pull out in front of you really quickly, hit the brakes and then you hit them,\u201d Fernandez said.\n\nPolice don\u2019t want to alarm people. At the South Precinct, they have had two or three victims of the technique, but not enough to send out an email warning the public.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already upset and you\u2019re already like \u2026 I hope they have insurance,\u201d said Akeylah Robinson, a victim of bump and rob. \u201cBut then you have to worry about is this person going to rob my car? Which is really scary.\u201d\n\nA few months ago, Robinson left her car running when it was stolen and used in a bump and rob.\n\n\u201cHe actually used my car to hit another family, a husband and wife and two small children, in the back,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom what I heard, at gunpoint told them to get out of the car, fired the gun and took their vehicle. And used it in another wreck.\u201d\n\nFernandez said drivers should be aware of their surroundings.\n\n\u201cLower the window a little bit. Lock your doors,\u201d he said. \u201cEvaluate, see if these people are quick to rush to your car. If they have something in their hands, like a weapon, then you want to leave there right away.\u201d\n\nIf there are children in the car, let the other driver know.\n\n\u201cAt least put it out there and let them know,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a child in the car. You take my child, you\u2019re talking kidnapping.\u201d\n\nPolice said most importantly, do what the thieves ask. Chances are good police will find the stolen vehicle.\n\nPolice have already solved a bump and rob that happened last week on Bell Road.\n\n\u201cWe want people to keep things in perspective,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cWe want everybody to be safe. It\u2019s property, you can get that replaced.\u201d\n\nPolice said as soon as they are in a fender bender, drivers should write down the license plate number and a few things about the occupants of the other vehicle. If they are approached by someone with a weapon who appears agitated, police said drivers should leave their keys and purse in the car, get out quickly, and leave the area immediately.","title":"Metro police say 'bump and rob' technique on the rise","media-type":"News","source":"WMCTV.com","published":"2015-09-01T22:59:00Z"}

Really, really fast. \n\n\"Big data,\" of course, has never truly been a matter of data volumes. At least, not exclusively. It has also fixated on data velocity (and variety), as Gartner's 3 V's popularized. \n\nBut knowing that data needs real-time processing and actually doing it are two very different things. \n\nTo better understand the industry shift toward fast, stream-based data processing, I reached out to Kevin Webber, developer advocate for Typesafe . Last year, his team led the rollout of Walmart Canada's new e-commerce platform built on a Scala\/Akka\/Play stack. I wanted to get more detail on the whitepaper that Dean Wampler authored. \n\nTechRepublic : What's the big idea behind fast data? Typesafe recently put out an interesting whitepaper on the topic, \" Fast Data: Big Data Evolved ,\" but tell me how it relates to the big data everyone talks about? \n \nWebber : Rather than acting on data at rest, modern software increasingly operates on data in near real time. So, big data is less important than fast data. \n\nAs our computing systems embrace data in motion, traditional batch architectures are evolving to stream-based architectures. In these systems, live data is captured, processed, and used to modify behavior with response times of seconds or less. There is major business value in sub-second response times to changing information. \n\nThink about 10 years ago when you didn't have a critical piece of market information until the day after it happened\u2014now, think about getting that critical piece of information as it's happening. This is going to create a lot of value for companies. \n\nAfter all, fast data is critical to fast knowledge, and businesses want knowledge as quickly as possible. \n\nTechRepublic : Typesafe is heavily involved in an industry initiative around so-called Reactive Streams that is all about fast data. What is that? \n\nWebber : Reactive Streams is a specification for toolmakers who are building the next generation of fast data frameworks and libraries for developers. Reactive Streams started as an initiative in late 2013 among engineers at Netflix, Pivotal, and Typesafe. \n\nThe goal of Reactive Streams is to bring the level of abstraction up a notch for data streaming use cases. Instead of developers worrying about the low-level plumbing of handling streams, the spec defines those problems, and it's up to the library developers to solve them. \n\nThat way, toolmakers can focus on the most challenging aspects of stream processing, while developers focus on their business, which is what they know the best. Even only a few years ago, building a stream processing system was simply too complex for most businesses to tackle. The goal of Reactive Streams is to change that and make it the de-facto standard for processing data in motion. \n\nTechRepublic : What's an example of a problem that Reactive Streaming addresses? \n\nWebber : A major objective of the spec is to define a model for something we call back pressure. In lay terms, it's a way to ensure that a fast publisher of real-time data in your system doesn't overwhelm a slower subscriber of that data within your system. \n\nIf you think of real-time data as water flowing down a river, at some point, heavy rain may cause the water to overflow and flood the surrounding area. Back pressure is a way to completely avoid flooding. \n\nImagine that a river could simply send a command upstream to slow the flow of water. That's back pressure, it's flow control\u2014a mechanism to provide resilience by ensuring that all participants in a stream-based system participate in flow control for a steady state of operation and graceful degradation if the stream flows at a rate beyond the capacity of the slowest component to cope. \n\nReactive Streams takes this up a notch and allows developers to connect different rivers together, so to speak, built with different compliant libraries. Back pressure works across all those libraries. It literally allows a developer to design systems that are immune to flooding, which\u2014in the world of streams\u2014results in Out Of Memory Errors and types of catastrophic crashes. \n\nWhat Reactive Streams provides is a bi-directional flow of data\u2014elements emitted downstream from publisher to subscriber and a signal for demand emitted upstream from subscriber to publisher. \n\nIf the subscriber is placed in charge of signaling demand, the publisher is free to safely push up to the number of elements demanded. This also prevents wasting resources. Because demand is signaled asynchronously, a subscriber can send many requests for more work before actually receiving any. \n\nThis is dynamic and changes in real time. When the subscriber is slower, it works like a pull-based system. When the subscriber is faster, it works like a push-based system. \n\nHow much value would you place on Reactive Streams in your organization?

The board did not vote to keep the quarry open, but will decide on specific measures at a future meeting. \n\n\u201cThe city has committed to keeping this open for people to swim in,\u201d said board member Paul Wertz. \n\nThe village went into closed session for nearly an hour, citing protection from an exemption in Wisconsin Open Meetings law that allows municipalities to meet to discuss ongoing or likely lawsuits. \n\nPersonal Injury Attorney Mike Siddall\u00a0of Fox Valley firm Herring Clark has\u00a0requested police reports and other documents related to the death of Alaya HauChee Lo, who drowned at the quarry in June.\u00a0Siddall did not return messages seeking comment Tuesday.

An earlier Post-Crescent Media story found that 19 people have\u00a0died there since 1979. \n\nDuring the meeting,\u00a0Sieg said police have issued more than 125 citations at the quarry between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, including\u00a0more than 50 tickets for possessing alcohol on quarry grounds, and another 24 citations for underage drinking. \n\nMost recently, Illinois resident\u00a0Marquis Hough\u00a0drowned at the quarry over Labor Day weekend. Redgranite officials cleared the quarry after he went missing on Sept. 6. His body was recovered the next morning. \n\nRedgranite Police Chief Kyle Tarr said police have not yet received Hough\u2019s toxicology results from the Fond du Lac County Medical Examiner, or results from this year\u2019s second victim, Daniel Whitmore of Green Bay, who drowned at the\u00a0quarry on Aug. 12. \n\nJohn Kroll, a lifelong Redgranite resident, attended Tuesday's\u00a0meeting\u00a0and said he\u2019s \u201csatisfied\u00a0with the board\u2019s decision to keep the quarry open. \n\n\u201cI grew up here,\u201d Kroll said. \u201cI hear everybody saying, they\u2019re making money on (the quarry).

It's real and you must do something.\" \n \nHis comments come on the back of Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton being caught on tape joking about low-lying islands being swamped by rising seas. \n \nThis was only days after the Pacific Islands Forum in Papua New Guinea, where climate change was a key focus. \n \nFoss said the decision-making process could slow down Teitota's deportation, scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. \n \n\"I have to make decisions like this every other day actually, some can be difficult but I have to abide by the rules that I have,\" he said. \n \n \u00a0  \n \n \u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \n    \nKey said the man's family situation and a plea to be allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds was a different issue to that of climate change.\u00a0 \n \n\"I, as an electorate MP sometimes do advocate for people, who have come to my electorate office for exactly those reasons; they're well ensconced in New Zealand, they're probably really good New Zealanders.\u00a0 \n \n\"But the only problem is we have a set of rules that say, you have to stick to those rules because basically the wheels fall off because everyone goes around the system,\" he said. \n \n\"But I don't think that claiming he's a refugee based on climate change, that that's a credible argument.\"\u00a0 \n \nThat may become a valid argument in the future, Key said. \n \n\"We can't rule out what's going to happen 30, 40, 50 years from now. But some of the scientists are certainly predicting quite a rise in sea levels, and if that's the case then it will challenge those low lying states and we understand that.\" \n \nLabour leader Andrew Little said the Government needed to set up a framework to deal with the issue of climate change in the Pacific Islands. \n \n\"We'll need the help of Australia, we'll need the help of other Pacific nations to do that.\" \n \n\"One of the promises we made for our seat on the Security Council to Pacific island nations is 'we will help you on climate change issues.' \n \n\"That's got to be real,\" he said. \n \nLabour MP for Te Atatu Phil Twyford is advocating on behalf of Teitoa and will collect a petition at Parliament on Tuesday calling for him and his family to be allowed to stay in the country. \n \nTwyford said the Government needed to \"get real\" about climate change because \"it's happening\". \n \n\"I've asked Minister Craig Foss to intervene in this decision, as he's able to do on humanitarian grounds, to allow this family to stay.\" \n  \n\u00a0","title":"John Key says Kiwis have sympathy for a Kiribati man facing deportation","media-type":"News","source":"Nelson Mail","published":"2015-09-22T03:00:32Z"}

I knew he's going to be aggressive. He's going to try to disrupt my rhythm, and he's going to put a lot of variety in his game.\n\n\"But I was ready for it. I was ready for the battle. That's what it was - three hours, 20 minutes.\n\n\"We pushed each other to the limit, as we always do. It's an ultimate challenge that I have now, winning against Roger back to back finals in Wimbledon and here, US Open.\n\n\"It's tremendous. I'm really, really proud of it.\"\n\nFederer was not the only obstacle Djokovic had to overcome, as the champion withstood immense support for his opponent throughout the match.\n\nAt times passion spilled over into hostility, as some spectators jeered Djokovic's shots and faults, which understandably agitated the Serbian, who ripped a button on his shirt after a particularly vociferous celebration.\n\n\"Obviously over the course of three hours 20 minutes match, you do have some ups and downs in concentration - you do sometimes let certain things distract you,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"But it's important to get back on the course and go back to basics and remember why you are there and what you need to do.\"\n\nDjokovic added: \"I accept the fact. Everybody has a choice to support a player that they want to support.\n\n\"He absolutely deserves to have the support he does because of all the years and success that he had and the way he carries himself on and off the court.\n\n\"No question about it. Me, I'm there to earn the support, and hopefully in the future I can be in that position.\"\n\nFederer only won two fewer points than Djokovic over the course of the match but committed 17 more unforced errors and was made to rue his 19 missed break points.\n\n\"I had too many break chances. Of course some of them I could have done better, should have done better, you know, all these things,\" Federer said.\n\n\"There were a lot of opportunities missed. If it's backhand, forehand, volleys, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day.\n\n\"I know why I lost the match, very clearly - the moment I sat down at 5-2 down in the fourth or after the match was over.\n\n\"It's something I will work on, and keep moving forward. It's no problem for me.\"\n\nDavid Beckham led a pack of celebrities in the stands, with Robert De Niro, Sean Connery and Robert Redford all in attendance, but rain delayed the start of the match by three hours and it was not until 7.10pm the players finally emerged.\n\nDjokovic had invited Scottish actor Gerard Butler into his box for the contest and the pair enjoyed an unusual exchange at the end of the match.\n\n\"We've known each other for several years and we are good friends,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"Funny enough, I actually sent him a photo and a message (on Saturday) night. I was watching the 300 movie so when I went to my box, I looked at him and I said, 'This is Sparta!'\n\n\"It felt great.

Less than 30 percent of SMB organizations leverage any type of accounts payable automation and only 36 percent have automated expense management processes.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, only 21 percent of SMB organizations cite their visibility into total spending as \u201cVery Strong,\u201d and according to Ardent Partners, this factor speaks directly to the need for not only managing company spend, but also automation of key spending processes. \n\n\u201cThere should be a new line of thinking among SMBs in terms of managing organizational spend: There is no company too small for holistic, automated spend management,\u201d said Christopher J. Dwyer, research director for Ardent Partners. \u201cIncreasing automation levels across spend management processes (purchasing, accounts payable, and expense management, in particular) is an effective, long-term approach towards not only driving superior cost control, but also greatly enhancing visibility into all facets of organizational spend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis new research underscores the value ExpenseWatch provides for small-and-midsized organizations,\u201d said Bill Vergantino, president and CEO of ExpenseWatch. \u201cAs organizations grow, more employees spend money while nearly every position can impact how much money is ultimately spent. With ExpenseWatch, organizations are empowered to automate spending processes and gain visibility and control, while driving cost savings which frees money to be reinvested to grow the business.\u201d\n\nTo download a free copy of How SMBs Can Manage Company Spending, visit http:\/\/www.expensewatch.com\/?p=5074\n\nAbout ExpenseWatch (http:\/\/www.ExpenseWatch.com) \n\nExpenseWatch automates manual, time consuming paper-based processes, for visibility and control over organizational spending, empowering customers to spend with confidence.

{"id":"3264270d-f4b2-4a53-a2ad-d28dce059c88","content":"The poles of a new fence on the border with Croatia are set up near Beremend, Hungary, September 21, 2015. REUTERS\/Bernadett Szabo  \nBy Balazs Koranyi \n\nSAROK, Hungary (Reuters) - Built in a matter of weeks by soldiers, prison labourers and cadres of the unemployed, a vast new wall along Balkan frontiers is a monument to the ruthless efficiency with which Prime Minister Viktor Orban has mobilised Hungary against migrants. \n\nOrban describes the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees and other migrants in Europe this year from Asia, Africa and the Middle East as an attack on the continent's Christian welfare model. \n\nUntil last week, most trekked through Hungary, the main overland entry route into the EU's border-free Schengen zone from the Balkan peninsula, which they cross after arriving by dinghy in Greece. \n\nWhile Europe dithered over a collective response, Hungary took matters into its own hands, shutting off the route with a new fence along its entire 175 km (110 mile) border with Serbia, topped with razor wire and guarded by helmeted riot police. \n\nIt was erected at a cost of 22 billion forints (about $80 million), a rare example of efficiency in a country which built its last underground metro line ten years behind schedule at triple the projected cost. \n\nThe government says it put the military in charge of the construction so that it could act more quickly. By swiftly mobilising state resources, the authorities also managed to turn the fence into a national project, immensely popular at home even as it is denounced by European partners. \n\n\"It took a while but the government\u2019s campaign to rouse public opinion against the refugees is bearing fruit, and having brought much of the media under control is paying dividends,\"     said Richard Szentpeteri Nagy, an analysts at Centre for Fair Political Analysis. \n\n\"By properly filtering the message through public television, what viewers at home see is that this is a mob, throwing stones and attacking police.\" \n\nIn just days since it shut the Serbian frontier, Hungary has already moved even faster to shut the border with Croatia, which is inside the European Union but outside the Schengen zone. \n\nA 41-kilometre temporary fence was thrown up within four days. Work is already underway on a permanent barrier, with machines clearing the land, fence posts driven into the ground and razor wire rolled out. \n\nNO EMOTION IN STEEL \n\nThe logistics are themselves a demonstration of Orban's vision of a powerful state flexing its muscle. \n\nThe military initially called in private contractors, but after Orban forced out his defence minister over the slow pace of work, soldiers swiftly took over most of the project. \n\nJanos, a dispatcher for a construction firm specialising in earth moving equipment, described a frenzied start. \n\n\"They found us through the Internet, I just got a call from the military asking if I could do the job,\" he said, asking that his surname not be used while discussing the process. \n\n\"They had something like two dozen private companies in the project then. But we're down to maybe a quarter of that as the military is getting its house in order and replaces us with their own capacity.\" \n\nHis firm gets paid 500 forints ($1.82) to drive a fence post into the ground. A crew needs to complete at least 200 in a day, 3 metres apart, to break even. The military schedule means working seven days a week. During the crunch when the defence minister was dismissed, his team put in more than 48 hours straight. \n\nParts of the fence have been made by firms using prison labour. Convicts receive a small portion of the wages paid for their work; the rest goes to cover prison costs. \n\nInmates from a prison on the outskirts of Dunaujvaros, Hungary's top steelmaking town, make up about a third of the 500-strong workforce at DAK Acelszerkezeti Kft., which worked on steel fence posts. Managing Director Gabor Tarany said his company did not care about politics; an order is an order. \n\n\"There\u2019s no emotion in steel; we build things and don\u2019t ask or care what it\u2019s used for.\" \n\nThe state has also mobilised unemployed people who collect government benefits through a public works programme. \n\n\"Public works people have an obligation to work, otherwise they could lose their benefits,\" said Marta Varga, a spokeswoman for the Csongrad county government offices. They have been paid at a monthly wage of around $220 for work on the fence, around half Hungary's minimum wage. She said no one had refused. \n\nFENCES, DOGS, COPS AND GUNS \n\nThe project has become a defining achievement for Orban, a square-jawed former student activist who emerged in the early days after Communism at the helm of Hungary's main centre-right political party Fidesz. \n\nNow 52, Orban has made a career of defying what he considers a weak-willed European consensus. Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the EU's executive commission, jokingly greeted him as \"Dictator\" at an EU summit in May, offering a smile and a slap on the neck. \n\nFrom 2010 until this year, Fidesz held a two-thirds supermajority in parliament which allowed Orban to amend the constitution, consolidating his authority. He drew fire for steps which EU officials said undermined the independence of the courts, central bank and the media. \n\nRealising early that migration would be a major issue, he moved quickly to stir public opinion this year with a series of campaigns, amplified by friendly media, including a new state controlled news channel. \n\nThe tactic has worked. A survey out on Monday showed Orban's Fidesz party leading its nearest rival by 10 percentage points. Another showed 82 percent supported tighter immigration rules. \n\nIn recent weeks he has been denouncing European leaders for accelerating Europe's migration crisis by abandoning any pretence of defending its external borders. \n\nHe reserves particular blame for Germany, which suspended normal EU rules to announce in August it would welcome Syrian refugees no matter where they enter the bloc. Orban's speeches and interviews have included warnings that Europe's Christian culture is in jeopardy from Muslim migrants, a tone critics say crosses a line into xenophobia. \n\nAfter the fence went up last week and Hungarian riot police used tear gas and water cannon on stone-throwing migrants, Romania's Prime Minister Victor Ponta even evoked the continent's darkest era - the rise of the Nazis. \n\n\"Fences, dogs, cops and guns: this looks like Europe in the 1930s. And did we solve the refugee problem with this? No, we didn't,\" Ponta said. \"Erecting a fence only throws the problem into Serbia, into Croatia, into Romania.\" \n\nOrban's opponents abroad say Hungary should be more compassionate, not least because of its own history, including a 1956 uprising against the Soviet Union when Russian guns and tanks drove nearly 200,000 Hungarians to flee. \n\nBut many Hungarians are having none of it. They say that even if today's migrants include refugees who have fled war, they have all arrived through safe countries such as Turkey and the Balkan states and are no longer in peril. \n\n\"Did the Hungarian refugees ever attack the police in a violent mob, throwing stones?\" said Zoltan Nogradi, the mayor of Morahalom, a small town on the Serbian border. \"There's no comparison because if there was no fence, my town would have already been swept away.\" \n\nMORE DISCREET \n\nThe government says putting the military in charge was the only way to build the fence quickly, exempting the state from cumbersome procurement laws. \n\nSome who worked on the project say there are other benefits: details can be kept secret, and the army itself has learned from the work. \n\n\"It\u2019s not just cheaper and quicker, it\u2019s also more discreet,\" said an engineer working on the Croatian border, who asked not be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media. \n\n\"Soldiers don\u2019t talk, prisoners can\u2019t talk and public works employees know it\u2019s not in their best interest to talk. \n\n\"Politics aside, this is the best logistical exercise the army had in years,\" he added. \n\nThe Defence Ministry, the arm of the military in charge of the construction and prison officials did not respond to written questions about the project. \n\nBut while the fence is popular at home, economists say Orban's stance on migration could damage Hungary's reputation within Europe, important to its economic future within the EU. \n\n\"Hungary needs to get a bit of perspective \u2013 and, frankly, humility on this issue,\" UniCredit economist Erik F. Nielsen said. \"It is only 25 years ago that the Hungarian government stopped fencing in its own people, and a very large share of the creation of Hungarian prosperity since then has been generated by Western European solidarity with the Hungarians.\" \n\n\"I am starting to wonder whether Hungary even belongs in Europe anymore,\" Nielsen added. \n\n($1 = 274.53 forints) \n\n(Additional reporting by Bernadette Szabo; Editing by Peter Graff)","title":"Insight - Orban mobilises Hungary's troops, prisoners, jobless to fence out migrants (Reuters)","media-type":"News","source":"West Australian","published":"2015-09-23T06:03:56Z"}

It touched me, so it doesn\u2019t surprise me that it touched other people as well.\u201d \n \nThe Gainesville, Florida, couple have nine children and 18 grandchildren. They\u2019ve been married for 73 years. \n \n\u201cThis video is pretty awesome because she\u2019s almost completely blind and he\u2019s fairly deaf, so it\u2019s difficult for them to communicate,\u201d Solari said. \u201cThis kind of thing between them, singing to each other, wasn\u2019t uncommon in our family. They were always singing and dancing and they\u2019d be very vibrant in that way.\u201d \n \nIn the video, Howard strokes his wife\u2019s face as he sings. Laura looks at her husband and mouths the lyrics. \n \nSolari\u2019s heart-warming video was a hit on social media. \n \n\u201cIt [the video] was posted minutes after it happened on Facebook and it had over three million views,\u201d she said. \u201cI know it seems private, but my family is very proud and happy to share this love with the world. As for the feedback, all the love and support we\u2019ve gotten, being around my grandmother, I believe it maybe it had a little bit of an impact of her feeling better. She\u2019s been able to go home and we are very appreciative of that as well.\u201d \n \nAfter being told the video had gone viral, Laura remarked: \u201cI told you Howard that I\u2019d make you famous.\u201d \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2015, ABC Radio.

He had to be evacuated by sea after the helicopter rescue team were unable to help the 28 year old victim. \n\nThe exhausted adventurer had made the journey along a coastal cliff top path that runs in between the Cala Moraig beach of Cumbre del Sol and the hidden cove of Cala Llebeig, a stretch of approximately two kilometers of rough terrain. A route used historically by fishermen, the trail descends down into the small cove which is where friends of the victim started to worry for the health of the man. Fearing he may suffer from respiratory failure, since he showed signs of extreme exhaustion and was unable to make the journey back, they called emergency services 112. The man is said to have been of large build and weighing over 150 kilos. \n\nThe tiny cove is inaccessible by road so the only options were for air or sea rescue. Emergency services ruled out the possibility of helicopter rescue so the SVS Company from nearby Cala Moraig made the evacuation by sea. He was taken to Cala Moraig where he was then transported by ambulance to the hospital in Denia.","title":"Tourist rescued from the fishermen\u2019s cove","media-type":"News","source":"EuroWeeklyNews","published":"2015-09-14T16:41:31Z"}

Featuring best-in-class sweep speed and unique test capabilities, the BTS Master-based CPRI RF measurement test set allows field engineers and technicians to conduct accurate RF measurements on Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) while remaining at ground level, eliminating the considerable expense and time associated with calling a tower crew to conduct interference measurements. \n\nWith the new option installed, the BTS Master can conduct RF measurements over the fiber optic CPRI link connecting the baseband unit (BBU) and RRH. To simplify configuring the CPRI link for RF measurements, Anritsu has developed preconfigured radio setups and an auto detect function in the option. \n\nA sweep speed 10x faster than other solutions in its class allows the BTS Master-based CPRI RF measurement test set to capture bursty signals missed by alternative methods. Complementing the sweep speed are two unique features \u2013 the ability to tune and pan on a displayed signal, and to zoom into a particular area of interest. Faster sweep speeds and more detailed signal analysis allow field engineers and technicians to more efficiently locate the sources of interference and PIM. \n\nUsers can conduct CPRI Spectrum and CPRI Spectrogram measurements with the test set. The overall performance and capability give operations and maintenance groups, RF performance engineers, NEM performance groups and other professionals responsible for wireless network optimization the ability to conduct all the required tests without the cost and time associated with dispatching a tower crew.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe CPRI RF option expands the comprehensive measurement capability of the BTS Master family, which consists of the MT8820T, MT8221B and MT8222B. All the handheld base station analyzers have been specifically developed to support 2G\/3G\/4G wireless networks, and feature over 30 analyzers in one instrument to meet virtually every measurement need. \n\nAnritsu also offers a portfolio of optical transport testers to test and verify the CPRI links. These solutions leverage Anritsu's extensive optical test history and can be used to confirm the RRH is powered-up correctly, that the fibers are connected correctly, the condition and cleanliness of the optical connector, and that the link has no excess loss from the RRH to the BBU. The transport testers can also verify that the correct wavelength SFP\/SFP+ modules are installed and that the modules support the rate configured. \n\nFor more information, visit our CTIA Super Mobility 2015 online press kit here: http:\/\/ctia.vporoom.com\/Anritsu \n\nAbout Anritsu \n\nAnritsu Company is the United States subsidiary of Anritsu Corporation, a global provider of innovative communications test and measurement solutions for 120 years.

{"id":"87995a77-63bf-4532-aa09-116ae227e2a4","content":"Following \u201cA Jihad for Love,\u201d his docu about gay Muslims, Indian-born, New York-based helmer Parvez Sharma again looks to prove that his faith and sexuality are compatible, this time surreptitiously shooting via iPhone in the no-filming zone of Islam\u2019s holiest city. \u201c A Sinner in Mecca \u201d is personal docu-making at its most strident, puffed up with righteousness as Sharma (justifiably) argues that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Wahabi fundamentalism runs counter to the religion\u2019s true loving precepts. Sensationalizing every moment of his hajj (pilgrimage) while calling attention to his devotion, the helmer comes across as far too pleased with himself, though countering the demonization of Islam is a necessary goal. A tiny Stateside release on Sept. 4 went virtually unnoticed, though TV sales should be more lucrative. \n \nAfter the release of \u201cJihad,\u201d Sharma was the target of a fatwa for apostasy, which is presumably why he approaches his hajj with such trepidation: \u201cI am consumed by my fear of death at the hands of the Saudis,\u201d is but one of the lines he intones, along with, \u201cA cold, naked fear filled me as I walked towards Saudi immigration.\u201d Ironically for a docu meant to counter the popular media perception of Islam as a religion of violence, \u201cSinner\u201d indulges in blatant scare-mongering that does more to put the helmer in a heroic light than challenge anti-Muslim narratives. Curiously, it also feels distinctly anti-Shiite. \n \nSharma calls his pilgrimage his hajj of defiance: \u201cI need evidence that my faith is strong enough to survive this journey.\u201d But the real taboo he breaks, ostentatiously even if nominally hidden, is to film in Mecca, a city off-limits not just to cameras but to non-Muslims. The lure of forbidden sites has attracted those of other faiths long before Sir Richard Burton famously entered the city in disguise in the mid-19th century, so Sharma makes much of his rule-breaking; it\u2019s his way of further critiquing Wahabism, even though restrictions on non-Muslims in Mecca predates Wahabism by multiple centuries. \n \nOnce there, he furtively films the various stages every pilgrim is enjoined to undertake, flagrantly ensuring that he gets selfies in prayer. Historians and cultural commentators have long lamented the way the Saudis have destroyed nearly all the old structures in the city, and Sharma rightly adds his voice, also complaining about the crass commercialization of the place. He criticizes how the Saudis have covered over and air conditioned the passageway Muslims must run between two hills (a ritual known as sa\u2019yy), and then indignantly criticizes the lack of facilities and conveniences for the vigil on the plain of Arafat. His is a hajj of bitterness and anger, and yet at the end he states, \u201cIslam\u2019s beating heart will now forever beat in my heart.\u201d \n \nRidiculous scary music accompanies Sharma\u2019s dramatic recreation of a chat he had with a gay Saudi while waiting on line, though it\u2019s a shame he never bothers to include an actual gay Saudi voice, even if disguised. Contrasted with the jazzy score overlaid on scenes in his Gotham apartment, the musical juxtaposition furthers Sharma\u2019s goal of vilifying the Kingdom, always from an outsider\u2019s p.o.v. Sequences in India allow him to reflect on his difficult post-coming-out relationship with his devout mother.","title":"Film Review: \u2018A Sinner in Mecca\u2019","media-type":"News","source":"Variety","published":"2015-09-29T20:57:45Z"}

When it's pointed at a self-driving car, it will trick the vehicle into thinking something is ahead and slow it down. If the laser pointer overwhelms the sensors on the car, the self-driving vehicle will stop. \n\nSelf-driving cars, which were initially popularized by Google but are now in the works at most major car makers, are widely viewed as a means to reduce congestion and improve safety on our roads. Self-driving cars use a series of sensors, lasers, and GPS technology to roam around town. All the while, the person in the car doesn't need to steer or press the gas\u2014the car does it all. \n\nThe trouble, however, is that a self-driving car's reliance upon laser-ranging systems, called Lidar, makes it susceptible to Petit's hack, he said. Lidar, which is not used in every self-driving vehicle technology, but is running in some, attempts to create a 3D rendering of the car's surroundings by using pulses of laser light. When Petit's technology is beamed back at the Lidar system, it believes there's a pedestrian or another object around it and reacts accordingly. \n\nWhether the hack will actually work in real life, however, remains to be seen. Petit tested his own technology on Lidar systems, but not on actual automated vehicles. It's also worth noting that self-driving cars are still several years off and security will be a major concern for companies. Finding bugs and addressing them sooner rather than later will undoubtedly be a focus, and sidestepping this nasty item may already be on a carmaker's docket. \n\nStill, it highlights an important fact: despite claims that they're safe, questions abound over how these vehicles will behave when they actually hit the roads. \n\nPetit will talk more about his findings at the Black Hat Europe security conference in November.","title":"A $60 Laser Can Bring Your Self-Driving Car to a Screeching Halt","media-type":"News","source":"PC Magazine","published":"2015-09-08T13:56:51Z"}

The S&P 500 inched up 2.32 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,884.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 26.65 points, or 0.59 percent, to 4,517.32.\n\nIn an analytical chapter of the IMF's flagship World Economic Outlook report, which is to be published next week in Peru, IMF economists found that the weak commodity price outlook could subtract almost 1 percentage point annually from the growth rate of commodity exporters over the 2015-2017 period as compared with the 2012-2014 period.\n\nAccording to the research, analysts generally agreed that commodity prices will likely remain low, given ample supplies and weak prospects for global economic growth, and the commodity futures prices suggest future spot prices for commodities will remain low or rebound only moderately over the next five years.\n\nSome analysts said the turmoil in commodities dominated the market sentiment recently, which caused a heavy sell-off in commodity stocks.\n\nOn the U.S. economic front, the Consumer Confidence Index stands at 103.0 for September, well above market consensus of 96.0, according to the New York-based research group Conference Board.\n\nThe S&P\/Case-Shiller's 20-City Index decreased 0.2 percent month-over-month in July, missing market expectations of a 0.1-percent gain.\n\nOverseas, Japanese stocks plummeted Tuesday, with the Nikkei index diving 4.05 percent to a over-eight-month closing low, as a drop in commodity prices and a global equities rout were extended further.\n\nEuropean equities also largely declined on Tuesday, with British benchmark FTSE 100 Index falling 0.83 percent, as investor sentiment turned negative despite recoveries in mining and oil prices.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, often referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell 2.90 percent to end at 26.83 Tuesday.\n\nIn other markets, oil prices bounced back Tuesday as U.S. consumer data came in better than expected.\n\nThe West Texas Intermediate for November delivery moved up 80 cents to settle at 45.23 U.S. dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent crude for November delivery increased 89 cents to close at 48.23 dollars a barrel on the London ICE Future Exchange.\n\nThe U.S. dollar fluctuated against most major currencies Tuesday amid uncertainties about the timing of U.S. interest rate hikes.\n\nIn late New York trading, the euro rose to 1.1258 dollars from 1.1234 dollars in the previous session, while the dollar bought 119.63 Japanese yen, lower than 119.83 yen of the previous session.\n\nGold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell on Tuesday for a third straight session, as data showed U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly rose in September.\n\nThe most active gold contract for December delivery lost 4.9 dollars, or 0.43 percent, to settle at 1,126.8 dollars per ounce.

For example, Quixey has partnerships with U.S. and global companies including Adelphic, Alibaba, AskMe, Opera Mediaworks, and PocketMath; publishers such as Times Internet; and with advertisers on social networks through Flightly. To date, Quixey has served over 300 million Deep View Card ads to its advertising partners. \n   \n\"Deep View Cards allow advertisers to better engage consumers with mobile apps - and it's working,\" said\u00a0Tomer\u00a0Kagan, co-founder and CEO of Quixey. \"We're now serving over 60 million impressions of Deep View Cards per month. This is the evolution of deep linking that marketers have been waiting for - to not just deliver a static ad with a deep link, but to generate dynamic ads featuring functionalities from apps at scale. We've spent the last five years evolving our technology and working with top engineers from around the globe to finally make the app ecosystem more accessible. And this is only the beginning.\" \n\nSince Deep View Cards are programmatic, they help advertisers get their content discovered and surface the most relevant app functions to users at scale. In an A\/B testing campaign on industry-leading ad platforms, Deep View Cards delivered 130-150 percent higher engagement in click-through rates compared to other campaigns. \n\n\"Deep View Cards are one of the mobile advertising formats of the future,\" said Deep Katyal, senior director, product innovation, Opera Mediaworks. \"They represent everything the mobile experience should be for users \u2013 easy, relevant, native, and at users' fingertips when they need them most. They capture and capitalize on user intent in an effective way because they display the exact destination within the app that will help users complete an action, not just pre-determined ad content or creative.\" \n\n\"We're always in search of innovative mobile advertising technologies that allow SeatGeek to get a leg up on our competitors and generate revenue at scale,\" said Will Flaherty , director of growth at SeatGeek. \"Quixey provided new technology solutions that did just this, and to date we've seen outstanding mobile conversion rates on the platform.\" \n\nQuixey uses a combination of content acquisition techniques and patent-pending native app mining technology, allowing Deep View Cards to be dynamic and rendered in real-time. Each Deep View Card represents the content and actions embodied by a specific function of an app, such as making a purchase or finding flight deals. \n\n\"Native advertising works phenomenally well, but mimicking the look and feel of a platform with ads is only half the solution,\" said Casey Grooms , co-founder of PocketMath. \"Quixey goes beyond native with Deep View Cards by allowing users to complete their transactions in one tap. Coupled with PocketMath, together we bring scalability wrapped up in a self-serve platform - delivering incredible engagement and results.\" \n\nDeep View Cards are also solving the challenges associated with the traditional approach to mobile app ad creative production.

{"id":"35fd2296-e230-4061-b130-6cfa42128359","content":") - HyperSolar, Inc. (OTCQB: HYSR), the developer of a breakthrough technology to produce renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water, today announced that it had reached 1.55 volts (V), a significant milestone achievement in its effort to split water molecules for the production of renewable hydrogen fuel.\n\nWhile the Company had previously met the challenge of exceeding 1.23 V, the theoretical minimum voltage needed to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, a minimum of 1.5 V is needed to do so for commercially viable real world applications. Examples of these commercial applications include hydrogen-charging stations for fuel-cell vehicles, or warehouse transportation for big box retailers. The 1.55 V breakthrough, in a low-cost single solar cell element, is representative of the tremendous progression of the technology, as the Company announced its 1.4 V breakthrough just one month ago. The results were recorded at the University of Iowa campus research location where researchers are currently focused on further increasing the voltages and currents achievable from their inexpensive light driven hydrogen generation particles. \n\nFollowing this breakthrough, the company will focus its efforts on increasing the hydrogen production efficiencies of these particles by bonding the ideal fuel production catalyst to the low-cost high-voltage solar cell. In order to achieve this, the company is currently exploring two parallel approaches. The first is to identify materials that interface with well-known hydrogen production catalysts, such as the platinum on solar particles, to improve sunlight-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. The second is to pursue methods that further increase photo voltages of solar particles to greater than 1.7 V that allow integration of cheaper earth abundant catalysts without significant loss in hydrogen production efficiency. \"This announcement represents one of the most important milestone achievements the Company has made to date,\" said Tim Young, CEO of HyperSolar. \"Both the University of Iowa and University of California, Santa Barbara teams have been instrumental in spurring the speed at which our technology has developed, resulting in this voltage breakthrough. We are focused on identifying the next steps for the technology that will make it possible for us to scale up to make a commercial technology that can produce hydrogen fuel at or near the point of distribution, using only water and sunlight.\" \n\nHyperSolar's research is centered on developing a low-cost and submersible hydrogen production particle that can split water molecules under the sun, emulating the core functions of photosynthesis. Each particle is a complete hydrogen generator that contains a novel high voltage solar cell bonded to chemical catalysts by a proprietary encapsulation coating. A video of an early proof-of-concept prototype can be viewed at http:\/\/hypersolar.com\/application.php.\n\nAbout HyperSolar, Inc.\n\nHyperSolar is developing a breakthrough, low cost technology to make renewable hydrogen using sunlight and any source of water, including seawater and wastewater. Unlike hydrocarbon fuels, such as oil, coal and natural gas, where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used, hydrogen fuel usage produces pure water as the only byproduct. By optimizing the science of water electrolysis at the nano-level, our low cost nanoparticles mimic photosynthesis to efficiently use sunlight to separate hydrogen from water, to produce environmentally friendly renewable hydrogen. Using our low cost method to produce renewable hydrogen, we intend to enable a world of distributed hydrogen production for renewable electricity and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

Hensling personally invites the talented designers featured on her site because as she notes, \"We take the time to know what our clients are interested in.\" The site's global storefront, international selection, competitive pricing, free shipping & guarantee makes shopping with GEMZ.GALLERY an obvious choice for those with discriminating taste.

{"id":"6b5edf78-f388-4e1b-bcc9-bd9f9c89f346","content":"FOXBORO \u2013 The first cut isn\u2019t the deepest in the NFL. The second one is. This past Tuesday, teams were required to cut their rosters from the 90 men they were permitted to bring to training camp to 75. By 4 p.m. Saturday, teams will be required to cut to the regular-season limit of 53. In the Patriots\u2019 case that means at least 21 of the players who were on their active roster for Thursday night\u2019s 12-9 loss to the New York Giants in the teams\u2019 preseason finale at Gillette Stadium will no longer be there come Saturday night. While the Patriots are currently at 75, with running back LeGarrette Blount staring at a one-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s substance abuse policy, they\u2019ll be allowed to actually carry 54 players into the regular season. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate part of the game when you can\u2019t keep all of the players who have worked hard and done everything that you\u2019ve asked them to do,\u201d Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said recently. \u201cYou have to make some tough decisions, but that\u2019s part of it. That\u2019s the National Football League. Not the great part of the job.\u201d Don\u2019t think that the Patriots\u2019 active roster will necessarily be set come Saturday night, however. In addition to establishing their 10-man roster (a process that can be undertaken on Sunday), the Patriots made 11 moves involving their active roster following the league\u2019s final cutdown date a year ago. Obviously, in hosting Pittsburgh as the reigning Super Bowl champions in the NFL regular-season kickoff at Gillette on Sept. 10, the Patriots (like the Steelers) will be operating within a much tighter time constraint this year. Who are those guys?: Google the term \u201camateur hour\u201d in today\u2019s Internet world and you\u2019re liable to find a YouTube video of Thursday night\u2019s game. Even under the variable pricing format the Patriots implemented for their season ticket holders a year ago this one was overpriced. Consider some of the central figures in this NFL non-classic: Ryan Lindley threw 45 times, completing 22 for 253 yards and no touchdowns (there weren\u2019t any scored on this night) with one interception in a complete-game effort for the Patriots that concluded with him getting sacked by Giants defensive end Damontre\u2019 Moore and coughing up the ball for a turnover at the New York 12 in the final minute. Ryan Nassib completed 16-of-32 passes for 193 yards and no TDs with no interceptions for the Giants. Tight end Asante Cleveland, he of the zero career receptions in six regular-season games, tied for the Patriots\u2019 team lead with four catches for 38 yards; Page 2 of 2 - Linebacker-defensive lineman Xzavier Dickson, the Patriots\u2019 253rd and last pick in this year\u2019s draft, was the team\u2019s second-leading tackler in the game with seven. Keep those names in mind. Some of them will soon be appearing in the \u201cNFL transactions\u201d section of a newspaper near you. Oh, well, at least those in attendance will always be able to tell their grandchildren about the night they saw Chris Boswell outkick Stephen Gostkowski, four field goals to three, in Foxboro. On this night, Tom Brady didn\u2019t even take the field \u2013 for warmups. A woman\u2019s touch: The officiating crew for the game included line judge Sarah Thomas, the league\u2019s first full-time female official.","title":"PATRIOTS NOTEBOOK: Cuts are coming around the NFL","media-type":"News","source":"Herald News","published":"2015-09-04T07:20:45Z"}

{"id":"1906ebe1-8211-418f-83c7-c8c667595004","content":"Firms staging mergers often do so in the light of significant benefit; the two firms can better work together to offer services to clients, or just reach an expanded marketplace with a better package. There's often a lot of value in mergers, though there are sometimes legal issues associated with this concept that need to be addressed. For BayRing Communications and Oxford Networks, meanwhile, a merger looked like a great idea, and has already received state and federal approval to go forth. \n\r \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r \nThe combination makes plenty of sense at first blush, and deeper inspection proves to change little. BayRing is a New Hampshire firm specializing in telecom and data center operations, while Maine's Oxford Networks joins in on telecom services as well. The two companies will reportedly make the largest telecom firm with a New England headquarters once it's all said and done, offering around 2,000 route miles of high-capacity fiber optics and access to nearly 50,000 commercial buildings. That doesn't include four Service Organization Control data centers, as well as the direct access to several major hub data locations. Just to top it off, its service ranges from southern New Hampshire into metro Boston and beyond. \n\r\n\r \nResults are already quite telling; reports suggest that the new organization's revenue streams have doubled, and now, a large swath of New England has a major new figure in both voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) and hosted private branch exchange ( PBX\u00a0( News - Alert ) ) systems. Operations won't change much as a result, as for the time being, both will keep current names and remain in current locations. \n\r\n\r \nThis is a pretty big move; it's always noteworthy when two smaller companies get together to make a much larger firm. Economies of scale can improve, and the two companies can focus marketing efforts instead of having to compete. Plus, since there's some difference between the two companies' offerings already, it can offer up a wider range of services to both of its current customer bases. This makes each firm more valuable to its current customers as services it previously couldn't offer can now be had, potentially making for a one-stop-shopping experience for current users. After all, if someone's already writing two checks to two different companies, and one of these can suddenly offer the services offered by the other, why not make the switch and just write one check? That saves time and effort, and when time and effort are saved at a corporate level, saving money generally isn't far behind. That increased fiber concept isn't unwelcome, either, as the rapidly-increasing demand for bandwidth on nearly every front will require fiber access to keep up with it. \n\r\n\r \nThere's a lot to like in the merger between BayRing Communications and Oxford Networks, and there will likely be plenty of customers that are equally happy about the whole thing. Competitors in the region, though, may have to step up current operations in order to match the proposition this newly-merged entity will be able to offer. \n\r \n\nEdited by Rory J.

{"id":"d6880afb-7fcb-4576-9d17-cedd343677f9","content":"ATHENS, Georgia (CNN) \u2013 Jeb Bush was scheduled to walk right up to a small stage and give brief remarks at a tailgate on Saturday, followed by photos with students before going to the Georgia vs. South Carolina game in Athens. \n\nBut when the Republican presidential candidate ventured into the tailgate space here on campus, it took him 24 minutes to inch through a thick swarm of students and fans to get to the stage. \n\nThe enthusiastic sea of mostly UGA supporters \u2014 armed in red Bulldogs swag and smart phones \u2014 crowded around Bush to get a look at the former Florida governor, but most importantly, to get a selfie. \n\nHis staffers gently tried to usher him through the crowd, but his campaign was more than happy to let the candidate take as many photos as requested, knowing most of the pictures would end up on social media \u2014 thus, free advertising. \n\n\u201cJust get \u2019em all on Facebook,\u201d Bush said jokingly at one point. \u201cTweet \u2019em!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s common for Bush to talk and take photos with audience members at his events. And while he spent more than four hours at the Iowa State Fair last month, he had yet to experience a continuous stream of fanfare like he saw on Saturday, where he was given rock star treatment from the crushing mob of people for more than 70 minutes. \n\nHis visit to Athens marked the first of three SEC football games that Bush will attend this fall, all part of an effort to court voters in the March 1 primary that will involve eight Southern states and deliver the nominating season\u2019s first huge haul of delegates in one day. \n\nAfter he worked his way to the stage, he was met by Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who endorsed Bush last month and introduced the candidate as someone who \u201cstands for everything that the party needs to be espousing.\u201d \n\nBush, with signs behind him that tweaked his \u201cJeb!\u201d campaign logo to look like the SEC logo, spoke for only three minutes. \u201cI\u2019m going to be very brief because I really like taking selfies,\u201d he said to big cheers from the crowd. \n\nThe candidate performed a condensed version of his stump speech, promising to grow the economy by 4.4% so that students can get jobs when they graduate and buy homes. \u201cA conservative can win the presidency and then fix these things so that you all will have a chance to live a great life,\u201d he said. \n\nThen it was back to selfies for another 50 minutes. \n\nFollowing his widely praised performance at the CNN debate on Wednesday, Bush hasn\u2019t been as eager to bring up contrasts with his rival, Donald Trump, by name in his speeches as he has been in recent weeks. \n\nStill, Bush jumped at the chance to mock Trump at one point Saturday when a voter near him commented on Bush being \u201chigh energy.\u201d The former governor whipped around to follow up: \u201cVery high energy!\u201d \n\nFriday night at an event in Michigan, Bush pounced on the latest controversy involving Trump and a supporter who argued at a rally this week that the president was a Muslim and questioned his status as an American. Bush defended Obama on Friday night, asserting that he was an American and a Christian. \n\nThe initial incident, which Trump didn\u2019t try to correct or denounce, renewed dialogue about tension in the United States between Muslims and non-Muslims. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a problem with Muslims in America,\u201d Bush told reporters Saturday. \u201cI think there\u2019s a problem with Islamic terrorism in the rest of the world and we need to confront that.\u201d \n\nBush added that \u201cof course\u201d Obama was born in the United States. Pressed on whether Trump should apologize for not calling out the questioner at his rally, Bush declined to weigh in further. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really, I\u2019m here watching the football game. Donald Trump\u2019s not really on my mind anymore,\u201d he said. \n\nThough the two quarreled Wednesday night in the debate, they also high-fived each other toward the end. Bush said Saturday that he doesn\u2019t hold any \u201cpersonal animus\u201d against Trump, but when asked whether Trump should still apologize to his wife for invoking her in the debate about immigration, Bush said: \u201cYeah. Yeah. Absolutely.\u201d \n\nThis week, Bush also got some attention from younger voters after he admitted on the debate stage that he smoked marijuana four decades ago. \u201cI\u2019m sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people,\u201d he said, looking around at his rivals on stage. \u201cMy mom\u2019s not happy that I just did.\u201d \n\nAsked Saturday whether he had heard from his mother yet, Bush said he tried calling the former first lady this week but she wasn\u2019t available. \u201cThankfully, she wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he said. \u201cI think she\u2019ll forgive me after 42 years, you think?\u201d \n\nWith a few crushed beer cans on the grass around him and the smell of alcohol in the air, it was clear that at least some of the enthusiasm at the boisterous tailgate was owed to normal game day libations. Only water was served at the event, but anyone was free to wander over and several came with drinks in tow. \n\nBush politely advised a couple of young people to pace themselves.\u201dSlow down there,\u201d he said to one young woman who was keenly fascinated with a sticker on his shirt. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to kickoff yet.\u201d \n\nAs for who the candidate was rooting for at the game, Bush said he was neutral, though he predicted Georgia would beat the Gamecocks. \n\n\u201cI think Georgia\u2019s going to win the SEC East,\u201d he added, as he was taking photos with a few South Carolina fans. \n\nThe Georgia fans quickly broke out into loud cheers: \u201cJeb for 2","title":"Jeb Bush goes tailgating: Selfies, Trump, selfies, economy, selfies","media-type":"News","source":"WXOK-AM","published":"2015-09-20T01:02:07Z"}

{"id":"5713c5b8-cacc-4ab5-b7e4-8bf87f81036c","content":"Without the games to distract from the issues, fans had more time to ponder the NFL's discipline policies, its commissioner and its overall credibility during an uncomfortable offseason. \n \nYes, the draft, the scouting combine and training camp were all designed to keep the league in the headlines long after the footballs stopped flying last February. But since the Patriots beat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl, those headlines have also been filled with news about scandals ranging from trivial (\"Deflategate\") to life-or-death (concussions and domestic abuse). \n \nFor those who only checked back in when their fantasy draft took place last week, here's a quick rundown of where things stand with kickoff now less than 48 hours away. (Not in order of importance): \n \nDEFLATEGATE: Last week, Tom Brady and the Patriots got a favorable ruling from a New York judge, meaning the quarterback will be available when New England hosts Pittsburgh in the league's opener Thursday night. The NFL has appealed the ruling \u2014 hoping another court will uphold Commissioner Roger Goodell's four-game suspension of the quarterback for a plot to deflate footballs before last season's AFC title game. The league claims it is appealing \"to uphold the collectively bargained responsibility to protect the integrity of the game.\" Something to watch: What will the NFL do if an appeals court reinstates the suspension in, say, November, when the playoff chase is in full force? \n \nRAY RICE: As has been the case since last November, the running back is eligible to play and available, after a judge overturned his season-long suspension following his arrest for punching his fianc\u00e9e on an Atlantic City casino elevator. There are a few teams in need of a veteran runner: Cleveland and Dallas come to mind. The NFL has always been a place of second chances, but not so much for a 28-year-old running back who was thought to be on the downside of his career before his suspension. \n \nADRIAN PETERSON: He is back with the Vikings after an offseason in which he wasn't initially eager to return, saying he felt a lack of support from the team and the state. The 30-year-old running back missed all but one game last year because of a child-abuse case and has been assured he'll make the $13 million he's owed this season even if he gets hurt. Peterson pleaded no contest last year to a misdemeanor charge of reckless assault for using a wooden switch to discipline his 4-year-old son. Earlier this summer, a Texas judge reduced his probation from two years to nine months already served. \n \nGREG HARDY: The linebacker missed all but one game with the Panthers last season after being convicted of domestic violence. The conviction was thrown out on appeal when his accuser failed to show up to testify. The Cowboys signed Hardy in March. A month later, Goodell suspended him for 10 games, but that penalty was reduced to four games by an arbitrator. \n \nRAY McDONALD: Last week, the former 49ers defensive lineman was indicted on one count of raping an intoxicated person. He'll be arraigned Sept. 25 and faces up to eight years in prison. In March, the Chicago Bears signed McDonald to a one-year contract, but they released him two months later after his arrest in a separate case \u2014 for allegedly breaking down a bedroom door to get to his former fianc\u00e9e and their infant. \n \nRICHIE INCOGNITO: The former Miami Dolphins guard sat out 15 months after being suspended as the primary offender in the bullying complaint made by Jonathan Martin. Incognito went unsigned last season, but is slated to start for the Buffalo Bills. Martin, 26, played for the 49ers last year, signed with the Panthers for this season, but then retied during training camp.\u00a0 \n \nCONCUSSIONS: Not so much a scandal, as a widening crisis. Payouts on the potential $1 billion concussion settlement between the league and former players are being delayed while as many as a dozen appeals are being heard. Other lawsuits from several former Chiefs and St. Louis Rams, including Neil Smith and Roy Green, are pending in Missouri, where it's possible team officials could have to testify about whether they hid the risk of repeated head injuries. How game officials handle head-to-head contact and return-to-play issues for players who may have suffered concussions will stay under the microscope. And then, there is the movie \"Concussion,\" due out at Christmas.","title":"Where NFL scandals stand with 2015 season on tap","media-type":"News","source":"Bluffton Today","published":"2015-09-09T17:28:11Z"}

These technical solutions utilize the ILA developed technology-agnostic System Architecture which provides interoperability for ILA member developed use cases. \n \nAn earlier InLocation Alliance member survey indicated Retail and Marketing at the top of their efforts to reap benefits in the short\/medium horizon. The results are confirmed by the wealth of announcements or products, trials, and deployment that are unceasingly being published. \n \nThe Indoor Location Based Services in Retail and Marketing White Paper illustrates the opportunities to retailers by describing some exemplary developments and deployments in retail and marketing while highlighting the importance of the ILA -- a catalyst for open innovation. \n \nThe Indoor Location Based Services in Transportation Hubs White Paper shows that the transportation sector is investing in and expecting significant innovation from indoor Location Based Services (LBS). Earlier this year, ILA recognized three leading innovations in LBS applications, two of which were related to the transportation sector. \n \n\"LBS capabilities in transportation hubs offer significant benefits to the operation of the facility, employees, vendors and passengers, creating a classic 'win-win' scenario for all the involved parties,\" said Jouni K\u00e4m\u00e4r\u00e4inen, Chair of ILA. \"The transportation focused White Paper addresses the growing value of indoor LBS, several specific applications and their value proposition, and the role of the ILA in accelerating the adoption of these capabilities.\" \n \n\"Although many notable examples of deployments in the retail and the transportation industry are already available, with some being reported here, the ILA believes that the time has come for a more extensive activity that will allow a deeper integration of the indoor location technologies in the business processes of both the retail industry and the transportation industry, to the benefit of all involved stakeholders,\" said Fabio Malabocchia, Use Case Working Group Chair for ILA. \n \nIndustry organizations and alliances as well as innovative companies in the Retail industry and in the transportation industry are invited to contact the ILA and cooperate with the alliance to fulfill this intent. \n \nThe latest news and releases from the ILA can be found at http:\/\/www.inlocationalliance.com . \n \nAbout the InLocation Alliance - Formally established August 2012, the InLocation Alliance is an industry collaboration dedicated to promoting indoor positioning solutions that directly benefit the industry and users of indoor location services and solutions on mobile devices.","title":"InLocation Alliance Delivers Two Use Case White Papers for Retail\/Marketing and Transportation","media-type":"News","source":"MarketWired","published":"2015-09-16T12:14:13Z"}

So far, 56 drivers have pleaded guilty to 112 charges, with fines totaling nearly $40,000, according to the City of Ottawa.\n\nUber has been banned or pushed out of some Canadian cities but continues to compete with traditional, regulated cabs in others.\n\nHere's a round up of the response to Uber across the country.\n\nKitchener-Waterloo became the first municipality in Ontario to propose regulating ride sharing services, like Uber. The new bylaw would require all Uber drivers to have a GPS and closed circuit television system, as well as commercial auto insurance policies for a minimum of $2 million to qualify for A City of Toronto staff report up for debate today calls for a new licensing category that would allow ride-hailing services, such as Uber to operate, but taxi industry leaders continue to argue that would mean the \"death of the industry.\"\n\nUnder the new licence, Uber drivers would have to buy a permit, carry insurance, undergo a background check and ensure their vehicle is safe. The report also recommends that base taxi fares be dropped by $1 to $3.25 to make traditional cabs more competitive. \n\nRead more about Uber in Toronto here.\n\nThe City of Edmonton has plans to legalize Uber with new regulations \u2014 but Uber drivers say the move would drive them out of business due to high costs. Uber drivers say the cost of criminal record checks, vehicle inspections, licence applications and commercial insurance would be about $6,800 a year.\n\nPublic hearings were scheduled at Edmonton City Hall today as Uber drivers planned to hold a rally outside.\n\nThe taxi industry in Vancouver successfully fought the relaunch of Uber last year. Uber was forced to stop operating after a brief time in Calgary in 2014. Calgary taxi companies joined other Canadian taxi companies in a campaign called Taxi Truths with the goal of detailing the differences between regulated and illegal cabs.","title":"Ottawa's response to Uber compared to cities across Canada","media-type":"News","source":"CBC","published":"2015-09-16T19:05:15Z"}

Source: AAP \n\nAUSTRALIAN businesses are anticipating a shot in the arm from the change in prime minister before Malcolm Turnbull has even spelled out policy. \n\nINDUSTRY bodies welcomed the arrival of a PM with a track record in business and warmed to the idea that the former investment banker can succeed where Tony Abbott failed, using a more collegiate and co-operative style of government to push through economic reforms. \n\nAnalysts say he could lift consumer confidence through his popularity with voters and help business by articulating the need for reform. \n\nBusiness Council of Australia president Catherine Livingstone said companies would respond to leadership that \"explains our national challenges ... while respecting the intelligence of the community to embrace change for the better\". \n\n\"A stronger economy for all will require a 10-year plan including ambitious tax reform that supports growth and fairness, a new framework for a modern and competitive workplace relations system, and a pathway to a meaningful budget surplus.\" \n\nRead more \n\nThe need for tax reform was echoed by Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Kate Carnell and Financial Services Council chief Sally Loane. \n\nMr Turnbull's willingness to compromise with political opponents could help get those reforms through. \n\nMs Livingstone said Mr Turnbull needed to focus on building an innovative and future-skilled economy to help boost productivity so Australia maintains its high living standards and social safety net. \n\nThe tech-savvy Mr Turnbull, who made millions from internet startup OzEmail in the 1990s, has regularly spoken on the importance of innovation. \n\nAi Group chief executive Innes Willox called him \"a world-class advocate well able to restart our stalled national reform agenda\". \n\nBusiness confidence is fragile partly due to the instability of a fourth prime minister in 28 months. \n\nWhile some analysts believe Mr Turnbull's elevation to prime minister could help improve confidence, AMP chief economist Shane Oliver sounded a note of caution. \n\n\"The change does nothing to alter the underlying fundamental challenge facing Australia, which is the end of the resources boom and the resultant sluggish economic growth,\" Dr Oliver said. \n\n\"But it does have the potential to help.\" \n\nIG market analyst Angus Nicholson said sentiment may improve after data last week showed consumer and business confidence dipping again. \n\n\"Traditionally with conservative pro-finance, pro-business leaders, which I think Mr Turnbull is regarded among the investor community, you often see a boost in consumer and investor confidence,\" he said. \n\n\"If it does provide a boost to confidence, that can also boost the real economy.\" \n\nMr Turnbull's negotiations with the then Labor government to secure passage of an emissions trading scheme directly led to his toppling as opposition leader by Mr Abbott in 2009, but analysts have downplayed concerns over his stance on climate. \n\n\"The Abbott government position on climate change even in the business community has been somewhat unpopular,\" Mr Nicholson said. \n\n\"Big companies like Shell have clearly seen the need to divest into renewables and diversify and invest in clean coal, so I don't think change on climate policy would be a deal breaker with the business community. \n\n\"The key thing is there needs to be proper discussion and consideration. The worst thing they could do would be sudden change.\"","title":"By Stuart Condie Liberals Economy: Industry bodies warm to Turnbull's ways","media-type":"News","source":"Geelong Advertiser","published":"2015-09-15T08:21:41Z"}

At Brentford, Garner, May and Doyle all started.\n\nIt was Keane and May in the Bournemouth tie, with Hugill joining the action as a sub and getting on the scoresheet.\n\nGarner and Keane started against Wolves, a pairing which was broken up within 20 minutes by Garner\u2019s red card.\n\nKeane continued as a lone striker until the 65th minute when Hugill took that mantle.\n\nMay will obviously be keen to start on Saturday \u2013 it was the Owls who sold him to PNE after just one season at Hillsborough.\n\nYou cannot ignore Hugill\u2019s claims either, as he has impacted well from the bench.\n\nThe clash with Wednesday will form part of a 6,602-mile road trip for North End in the Championship this season.\n\nResearch done by JustPark shows that if a Preston fan drove to every league game, they would spend \u00a31,075 and be on the road for 112 hours.\n\nThe longest trip of the season comes next month with a first ever visit to league leaders Brighton\u2019s Amex Stadium.\n\nThat is a 568-mile round-trip by car, taking around eight-and-a-half hours.\n\nIn total, Championship clubs and their supporters will travel a total of 155,000 miles this season.\n\nBrighton have the most travelling to do, with 8,758 miles on the clock by the end of the season.\n\nDerby will spend the least time on the road, covering 4,914 miles from their East Midlands starting-point.\n\nJustPark is a parking app which allows football fans to book cut-price parking spaces on local driveways when attending matches.","title":"Time to strike while PNE ace Joe is banned","media-type":"News","source":"Lancashire Evening Post","published":"2015-09-29T13:59:03Z"}

Baker, III is leading a 22 member delegation of business and government officials to China looking toward investment opportunities and partnerships with Chinese business owners and investors. While we were resting up for Labor Day on Sunday, the Prince George's County delegation began its first full day on the mission with a quick stop at the Great Wall of China then gathered to tour the Zhongguancun China Science Park (Z-Park) in Beijing. Z-Park is China's premier science and technology development center and was the first state-level high-tech development zone approved by the State Council in 1988. This Beijing icon is very well known in China and is often referred to as China's \"Silicon Valley\" because of its connections to information technology and its strategic cooperation with other science parks.\n\nWith a stack of bilingual business cards in their pockets, the delegates were treated to lunch at Z-Park by the Rechsand Science and Technology Group, and met with 40 tech companies that were eager to do business with members of the delegation. After lunch, EDC President Jim Coleman presented to the Z-Park companies the value of doing business in Prince George's County, why Prince George's County is the \"Gateway to the U.S. Market\", and the mission delegates' investment and partnership opportunities. Mr. Coleman also officially announced the opening of the China Business Center in the Prince George's County Economic Development Corporation. The China Business Center offers Chinese-based companies a successful 'launching pad' to enter the United States business market. With services ranging from office space to recruitment of local staff, the China Business Center is a turnkey solution for any Chinese based company seeking to grow sales by selling innovative products to U.S. based companies and government agencies.\n\n\"I am delighted by the response we have been getting from China's business and government leaders,\" said EDC President and CEO Jim Coleman. \"With the investment opportunities that our delegation is presenting this year, we are hoping to duplicate the Rechsand partnership model and confident that these projects will be coming to fruition very soon.\" \n\nThe Rechsand Science and Technology Group is a company that the Baker Administration touts as one of its successes from the 2014 China Mission. Through the partnerships that were created on that mission, the County facilitated an alliance between Rechsand and Corvias Solutions - the company that won a $2 billion contract with the County for storm-water management project. This alliance has generated a partnership\/presence with Prince George's County and helped create the \"Sponge City\" initiative where Rechsand's technology (based on a model from Prince George's County) will be used in 16 cities around China to improve water quality.\n\nIf you are interested in doing business internationally, contact Elizabeth Crittenden (eacrittenden@pgcedc.com) or 301-583-465","title":"Prince George's China Delegation Hits the Ground Running","media-type":"News","source":"Consumer Electronics Net","published":"2015-09-10T13:55:44Z"}

The GDP grew at 7.5 percent in the January-March quarter while it was 6.7 percent in the April-June quarter last year, according to data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO).\n\nTo a query on whether concerns on Chinese currency and Fed rate hike were raised at the G20 meeting, Jaitley said comments were made from various quarters in this regard.\n\nWhen asked whether industry's concerns over land acquisition would come in the way of economic growth, the finance minister said the government has already indicated an \"alternative road map\" in that regard. He said states would be free to pass their own land acquisition laws.\n\nAlso Read: Finance Ministry May Introduce MUDRA Bill","title":"China Slowdown, U.S. Rate Hike Transient Factors; India to See Respectable Growth: Jaitley","media-type":"News","source":"Silicon India","published":"2015-09-07T00:00:00Z"}

{"id":"3deea828-e3a1-4c4d-9a90-482cabc020d8","content":"NBC's new drama The Player  has one of the most ridiculous premises of any of the new fall TV shows -- but that's not a bad thing. Unlike so many of the shows trying to \"cut through the clutter\" with a splashy concept, The Player knows exactly what it wants to be: a high-octane crime thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously. And it shouldn't with a setup like this: Alex Kane ( Philp Winchester ) is a private security specialist in Las Vegas who, after the murder of his wife Ginny ( Daisy Betts ), is pulled into a long-running conspiracy involving the richest people in the world gambling on crime. With the help of \"pit boss\" Mr. Johnson ( Wesley Snipes ) and \"the dealer\" Cassandra ( Charity Wakefield ), Alex, as \"the player,\" tries to stop crimes while the fat cats in \"the house\" bet on or against his ability to save the day. Got all that? \"We knew we wanted to make a pulp show,\" co-creator John Rogers tells TVGuide.com . \"The way pulp works is to find a good, simple, defining metaphor, and we said, 'What are the elements of gambling?' If you're going to have a conspiracy, you're going to have code names, you're going to a have a structure. When we looked at the basic form of gambling, the feel of a casino, and it just came very naturally. People understand those terms -- millions of people gamble. We're not introducing obscure vocabulary to explain our very high-concept, obscure conspiracy.\" Fall Preview: Check out all the must-watch new shows But it was also important for Rogers to have some emotional context beneath all the Las Vegas window-dressing. \"Everyone right now feels as if maybe the rules were changed on them,\" Rogers says. \"You sent your kids to college, but somehow your college graduate is living in your basement because he can't get a job. It feels like we're trapped in a game that somebody changed the rules. We said, 'Why don't we externalize that? Why don't we talk about the fact we are trapped in a game, and there's one guy in the middle of it who is on our side?' That gave us the emotional stakes of the show.\" Page 2 of 3 - For Alex, his journey is entirely fueled by the heartbreak he feels over the death of his wife. \"Trying to resolve how Ginny died and why she died and who's responsible, is the primary emotional thrust of his investigation,\" Rogers says. \"That's the thing that keeps him going back undercover into this organization.\" And continuing to go back in is an issue. After all, the whole concept of a group of people profiting off of crime rather than trying to prevent it is pretty icky, right? \"They're doing a horrible thing,\" Rogers says with a laugh. \"It allows us to have some fun every week, but they're plainly bad guys. Alex is a good guy in the middle of a bad system. One of the essential questions of the show is: Is that system actually the best possible system that we can live with?\" Because of Alex's unease about what he's doing, The Player is unlike most procedurals where the team is one big happy family. Instead, when, in the pilot, Alex threatens to kill Mr. Johnson one day in the not-too-distant future, you're inclined to believe him. However, the team still has to rely on each other, regardless of how much they trust their colleagues. \"Everyone has their own agenda, everyone has their own secret plan, and everyone has their own sort of shifting allegiances,\" Rogers says. \"They are in a life-and-death world, and they have to trust each other as far as they can to not die, but never trust each other enough to make themselves vulnerable.\" The Player 's Wesley Snipes and more familiar faces in new places That central conflict will certainly begin to define Mr. Johnson's moral ambiguity, which is exactly what attracted Snipes to the role. \"I get to explore some character work in a way that I probably couldn't in a feature film,\" Snipes says. \"You never know which side he's playing for. You'll learn quickly that Mr. Johnson knows secrets that no one else knows. He's seen a lot of players come and go, and this guy is nothing special at this point. Or so we make it appear. Mr. Johnson has another card that he hasn't played yet. There's a whole deck that Mr. Johnson hasn't played yet.\" However, Rogers is quick to caution people from deciding outright that Mr. Johnson is the bad guy. \"There are weeks that Mr. Johnson does something heroic because it fits his sense of personal ethics, and you're like, 'Yeah, I love Mr. Johnson!'\" Rogers says. \"Then, there are days that he's the most horrible human being in the world. I don't know if you ever want to be rooting for him, but you should be fascinated by him. ... His views on power are not necessarily wrong, they're just horrible.\" Page 3 of 3 - Then again, Alex isn't an entirely noble hero either. \"He's saving lives. He genuinely enjoys the work, but Alex Kane has a problem. He is a man with a high capacity for violence and a tendency towards it,\" Rogers says. \"To a great degree the two themes for the show are power and addiction. We all have behaviors we're drawn to. We all have those things we can't let go of, be it Ginny's death or the constant fall into violence which comes very easily to him. We all have these desires that are beyond our control, and how we deal with them to a great degree is what defines us.\" Although the show is clearly reveling in its procedural makeup (\"I love the one-and-done of it,\" Rogers confesses), the writers are telling a longer story. However, the central mystery of Ginny's murder, which gets much more messy by the end of the pilot, won't be stretched out forever. \"The mystery of how that happened, who did it, why it was done -- all of that is meant to be an important thing that we reveal to the audience over the course of the first 12 episodes,\" Rogers says. \"We're not going to hold you over a barrel for five years. Most of the questions in the first season will be resolved by the end of the first season.\" The Player premieres Thursday at 10\/9c on NBC. Will you watch?

Some are excellent, but one in particular is a little suspect, promising a better mobile internet experience, if you don\u2019t mind the associated costs, that is. And most of us, I fear, would rather have less-than-perfect\u00a0connectivity than an inflated data bill. \n \nIf you go to \u201cSettings\u201d, then \u201cMobile Data\u201d, and scroll right to the bottom, you\u2019ll find something called \u201cWi-Fi Assist\u201d on an iPad or iPhone that\u2019s been updated to iOS 9. This feature will be turned on by default after the update.\u00a0What it does is\u00a0automatically switch you over to a mobile data connection once the device\u00a0detects that a Wi-Fi connection is poor or weakening. So, for example, when you leave an area with Wi-Fi \u2014 like your home or office or that coffeeshop with the crummy coffee but fibre internet \u2014 you\u2019ll see your device trying to cling to the connection until the last possible moment.

I was going to participate in a  conference in Morocco with the Arab sports leaders association and [another  conference] in Sharm el-Sheikh. I have conferences that I want to attend in  October in Bahrain and Morocco, the conference for female Arab sports reporters,  but until now I don\u2019t know if I will be able to get out of Gaza or not,\u2019\u2019 she  said. \n\nAs a member of the West Asian Athletics Association media committee  and vice president of the women\u2019s sports committee in the Palestinian Olympic  Committee, Masri is making strides in her field. \n\nAnd according to her  father she\u2019s a role model for other women wanting to follow in her  footsteps. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to me as an athlete and as a modern man who  lived the experience to encourage a role for woman in society. The woman should  pave her way in society as she likes it and it\u2019s in line with her  hobbies. \n\nI support women to be a part of society. We are a Muslim and  modern society that understands the traditions of our country and homeland,\u2019\u2019  said Ismael al-Masri. \n\nA blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt means  residents cannot import many basic construction materials to rebuild, as they  can be used to build weapons and attack tunnels. Israel no longer gives work  permits to Gazans, and only a tiny few ever receive permission to set foot out  of the increasingly impoverished enclave, the rest confined indefinitely to an  area less than half the size of New York City. \n\nAccording to the World  Bank, Gaza now has the world\u2019s worst-performing economy, with the world\u2019s  highest unemployment at 43 percent, 68 percent among those aged 20-24. Since  1994, real per capita income has fallen by nearly a third. Manufacturing \u2013 once  the hoped-for backbone of an economic revival \u2013 has shriveled by 60  percent. \n\nBut despite the setbacks, Masri remains committed to covering  stories beyond the Gaza border.","title":"Gazan female sports journalist aims to go beyond the border","media-type":"News","source":"Jerusalem Post","published":"2015-09-09T22:25:55Z"}

{"id":"eea8334b-71a2-4af5-9a38-b1ec8da3cbab","content":"by Tony Crescenzi, PIMCO  \nMany investors are familiar with the adage, \u201cthey don\u2019t ring a bell,\u201d to warn when it is time to get in or out of an investment. Well, sometimes they do, or so the famed scientist Ivan Pavlov would likely contend. The physiologist trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell, having conditioned them to associate the bell with the delivery of food. Pavlov discovered that he didn\u2019t actually have to deliver the food to get the canines to salivate in anticipation. \n \nIt is no different in markets, where the anticipation of an event can invoke the same response as the real thing. Market participants seek to discount the future, after all. \n \nIn 2015, market volatility has been rooted in a phantom rate hike from the Federal Reserve, which throughout the year has been ringing a bell to warn markets that it is on the verge of raising interest rates for the first time since 2006. Though it hasn\u2019t happened, the Fed has elicited a typical Pavlovian response, causing markets to shudder at the thought and prompting a very significant chain of events that has rippled throughout global financial markets. While anticipation of the Fed\u2019s rate hike isn\u2019t the cause of market volatility, it has been a catalyst . \n How the greenback turned markets red  \nThe chain of events began, as we noted in the April publication of the Global Central Bank Focus , with a rise in the value of the U.S. dollar at the end of 2014 (Figure 1). The ascension was predicated upon the idea that global central bank policies would begin to diverge, with the Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates at a time when the rest of the world and, in particular the developed world, was still in the midst of providing new monetary accommodation. This started the ball rolling. Yet, there was no actual rate hike. \n \n\n \nThe strengthening U.S. dollar and the anxious anticipation of a Fed rate hike by investors throughout the world sparked a cascade of events, all inextricably linked. One of these events has been a decline in commodity prices (Figure 2), which often fall when the dollar strengthens. The decline hurt markets in commodity-producing nations, including many in the emerging markets. Declines in commodity prices and attendant weakness in emerging markets has dominated markets this year, spilling over into developed markets by weakening equity markets, widening credit spreads and suppressing interest rates. \n \n\n \nThe most prominent of the commodity price declines has been energy prices (Figure 3). Although the decline is rooted in significant global supply and demand imbalances, the dollar\u2019s strength has played a role too, and it has wreaked havoc in many financial markets while also significantly weakening capital expenditures in the energy sector. \n \n\n   \r\n\r  Even China felt the phantom hike  \nThe biggest fallout from the Fed\u2019s phantom rate hike has been in China. The strengthening U.S. dollar, to which China\u2019s currency is quasi-pegged, caused China\u2019s currency, the yuan, to strengthen on an inflation-adjusted basis at a time its economy was weakening. This is the opposite of what tends to happen and it is an undesirable outcome for a central bank seeking to stimulate economic growth by cutting interest rates, as China has. China recognized this and took action to weaken its currency on August 10, aiming to bolster its export sector (Figure 4). Global financial markets were riveted by the unexpected move, spurring substantial market volatility highlighted by a plunge in global equities prices. \n \n\n \nChina-related volatility generated a feedback loop in global markets, resulting in further weakness in commodity prices and emerging markets, keeping downward pressure on global equities and upward pressure on credit spreads. \n \nThe result has been a tightening of overall financial conditions that, if continued, would threaten the global economic outlook. These \u201cinternational developments,\u201d as the Fed has called them, are what led the Fed to delay the rate hike it otherwise was likely to deliver at its September 17 policy meeting. \n Fear of a hike in a post-crisis era enough to significantly tighten financial conditions  \nA tightening of financial conditions is a desirable outcome for central banks that embark on a path to raise interest rates, but the Fed hasn\u2019t taken a single step onto the path. If it had, it would want its reduction in monetary accommodation to transmit through these five channels: \n Stock prices  Bond yields  Credit spreads  Lending standards  The value of the U.S. dollar  \nAs we noted in April, it\u2019s that fifth channel \u2013 the value of the U.S. dollar \u2013 that has received the most attention this year, even though the other four have a far larger bearing on economic activity. Now that the other four have been infected by the fifth, the Fed is naturally concerned about risks to the economic outlook. \n \nThat markets have moved so significantly on the prospect of a Fed rate hike exposes the fragility of the global financial system, which remains mired in a lengthy era of deleveraging (Figure 5). It demonstrates the difficulty that central banks face in escaping crisis-era policies, including zero percent policy rates. In fact, as former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke has reminded us at our quarterly cyclical forums in Newport Beach, no nation has ever successfully escaped the zero bound in the postwar era. \n \n\n \nFor investors, what mattered this year was not whether or when the Fed would raise interest rates, but whether the markets still perceived the Fed to be the first mover. In other words, going forward, this means that as long as the divergence theme between the world\u2019s central banks holds intact, so will the anticipatory response in the global financial markets. Mind you, several major central banks will attempt to wrestle back control for their own sake, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the People\u2019s Bank of China. But all, including other central banks, will remain strongly influenced by what the Fed does \u2013 or does not do \u2013 next. \n Investment implications and lessons for investors from this year\u2019s tumult  \nThere are five primary investment implications and lessons for investors to draw from this year\u2019s tumult in the global financial markets: \n Rates are likely to stay low for longer: In keeping with PIMCO\u2019s New Neutral thesis, the Federal Reserve has demonstrated that it is likely to take a very gradual \nLike this article?

{"id":"cf7d6846-d9b1-4423-9ab5-ba50fccae7f1","content":"The Chiefs\u2019 ever-shuffling offensive line took another twist with Monday\u2019s announcement that left tackle Eric Fisher, who missed most of the preseason with a high ankle sprain, would be return to action for Sunday\u2019s opener at Houston. \n\nAnd start at another position. \n\nFisher will open at right tackle, Coach Andy Reid said. Donald Stephenson will start at left tackle. \n\nThe rest of the starting offensive line: Ben Grubbs at left guard, Mitch Morse at center and Laurent Duvernay-Tardif at right guard. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to play the five best, and Fish gives us a whole lot of flexibility, he can play any position on the offensive line, and play at Pro Bowl caliber,\u201d Reid said. \n\nFisher, the NFL\u2019s overall top selection in 2013, returns to the position he played as a rookie. Asked if it was disappointing that Fisher didn\u2019t remain on the left side, Reid didn\u2019t bite. \n\n\u201cDid you hear what I just said?\u201d Reid said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that.\u201d \n\nWith Fisher\u2019s injury, Stephenson had played left tackle throughout the preseason. \n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s just leave him there, it looks like he\u2019s comfortable with that,\u2019 \u201d Reid said. \u201cHe was more comfortable there than at right tackle. He had some ups and downs at that right tackle spot.\u201d \n\nReid said the offensive line was constructed in groups by pairing Fisher with second-year pro Duvernay-Tardif, who will make his NFL debut on Sunday, and the two-time Pro Bowler Grubbs with Stevenson, who has 14 career starts. \n\n\u201cThe way it sets up, it works out perfectly,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI think Grubbs is tremendous for Donald and Fish is tremendous for (Duvernay-Tardif). It\u2019s a good match there. \n\n\u201cFish knows the offense backwards and forward, Fish had it down, he\u2019s a very smart kid this is his third year playing, and that\u2019s great for Larry. \n\nGrubbs and Donald kind of hit it off. I like that chemistry there.\u201d \n\nFisher injured his ankle and projected starting right guard Jeff Allen suffered a sprained knee. Neither played after the preseason opener. That\u2019s when Stevenson moved to left tackle and Duvernay-Tardif started at right guard. \n\nThe starting offensive line had early struggles in the second preseason game, against the Seattle Seahawks, but played better in the third game against the Tennessee Titans. The starters didn\u2019t see the field in the fourth preseason game, at St. Louis on Thursday. \n\nStevenson started three games at right tackle and four at left tackle in 2013 and worked at left tackle during the team\u2019s organized activities in the spring. Reid said at the time he was just giving Stephenson reps there to help develop is versatility. \n\nBut Reid said Monday the left side is a better fit for Stephenson, who played at Blue Springs High and Oklahoma. \n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s more comfortable on the left side than the right side,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI thought Fish was having a phenomenal camp on the left side. This was something I had to think through. But with Fish\u2019s injury, Donald gets in there and it became very evident he was more comfortable on that side than on the right side.\u201d \n\nVersatility was a buzzword for Reid and general manager John Dorsey when discussing the offensive line. \n\nThe Chiefs moved Zach Fulton, who started at right guard last season, to center against the Rams. Fulton had never played the position in an organized game but by all accounts held his own. \n\nThe signing of tackle Jah Reid, cut by the Ravens on Saturday, also supports the Chiefs needs to be flexible. \n\n\u201cHe can play all four sports, not center, both tackles, both guards,\u201d Dorsey said. \n\nThey\u2019re about to face a Texans defense that features reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt, but Reid likes what the Chiefs will present. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m very comfortable with this group right now,\u201d he said.","title":"Right back where he started, Chiefs\u2019 Fisher moves to right tackle","media-type":"News","source":"KansasCity.com","published":"2015-09-07T20:00:47Z"}

But when the request to look at a trial involving the handling of shrimps was received it did cause a few furrowed brows. \n\nCooked shrimps are extremely delicate and they need very careful handling. The process packaging company had won the order but their current machinery was unable to handle this tricky crustacean without feelers getting caught in a mesh or joint which left the shrimp hanging on the belt and finally falling on to the floor when the shrimp parted company with its feeler \u2013 which left the feeler stuck in the belt. In some cases, it wasn\u2019t just a lost feeler; heads or tails could remain in the belt. In a business as dependant on appearance as it is on product quality, decapitated shrimps presented a problem that needed urgent solving. The packaging contractor searched on-line and found Liftvrac. \n\nThe Liftvrac conveying system is a revolutionary form of belt conveyor which is ideal for handling sticky or delicate products like shrimps. It is easy to clean and maintain and is extremely economic in terms of energy consumption. The key component is a polyurethane belt which forms a tube around the product and carries it the entire length of the elevation. A lip system effectively seals the tube and holds the product in place until it\u2019s discharged at the end of the line. Fish, cheese, pasta, meat, plastics and a huge range of other products can be conveyed without any fear of blockages or clogging thanks to a scraper located at the discharge end of the belt. The entire system can be dismantled, cleaned and reassembled in around twenty minutes \u2013 ideal if different products are going to be conveyed. \n\n. \n\nNeedless to say, the shrimp test was a complete success. The smooth tube-shaped conveying belt delivered the shrimps into the weigher in the same state prior to conveying and after an extensive test it was found that product wastage from conveying was practically zero as opposed to around 2% with the packaging contractors existing system.\u00a0","title":"Amazing; conveyed shrimps complete with heads!","media-type":"News","source":"Food Processing","published":"2015-09-08T20:37:49Z"}

The Ivory Coast international sprung the offside trap and lashed a\u00a0strike into the bottom-left corner. \n \nAnd there was to be one final twist in the tale, which came as Lukaku latched on to another fine Deulofeu delivery, following up a heavy first touch by squeaking the ball in at the near post to complete an impressive fightback.","title":"West Brom 2 Everton 3: Lukaku inspires superb second-half fightback","media-type":"News","source":"SoccerWay.com","published":"2015-09-28T21:21:55Z"}

SAP Fiori requires significant upgrades to an exacting \"stack\" of SAP platform and application modules, including the implementation of SAP HANA. The Oracle Mobile Platform requires an arduous migration to Oracle Fusion architecture, middleware and applications. Both are based upon HTML5, which has renowned constraints in performance and user experience. Further, if you want to use their portfolio apps, you must modify them at the source code level to reflect the customizations you have made to their back-end applications. \n   \nStarMobile radically simplifies enterprise mobility by dynamically transforming any packaged on-premises (e.g., SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Infor, etc.) or cloud-based application (e.g., Salesforce, Workday, etc.), or custom-built system (including legacy \"green-screen\" applications), and any workflow into a mobile app with a native user experience. Therein, StarMobile leverages the enterprise's existing investments in applications, workflows, infrastructure, data, and security without having to \"re-create\" them on each mobile device platform. StarMobile also provides the means to develop net new \"mobile first\" apps by connecting with APIs, data connectors, SQL, web services and mBaaS. \n\n\"SAP and Oracle have effectively abandoned their installed customers by using mobility as a means to force time consuming, complex and expensive upgrades upon them,\" said StarMobile President and CEO Todd Fryburger. \"StarMobile eliminates the need for such vendor-imposed upgrades. We allow SAP and Oracle customers to dynamically transform any application, without changes, for use on any endpoint, with a native user experience and integration with native device features. For about the cost of one cup of coffee per user per month, StarMobile provides the means for SAP and Oracle customers to mobilize their applications with speed, simplicity and economy that no other solution in the industry offers today.\" \n\nStarMobile customers, such as global consumer packaged goods company Mondel\u0113z International , use the StarMobile platform to create and deploy purpose-built mobile apps that leverage their existing SAP and Oracle applications. \n\n\"The StarMobile platform has enabled Mondel\u0113z to transform our existing investments in the systems and processes we use to run our business for use on mobile devices,\" said Carl Van Dusen, global head of mobility and integration at Mondel\u0113z International.  \"Anytime, anywhere access is essential to empowering our mobile workforce, and StarMobile allows us to deliver enterprise mobility quickly, simply and cost effectively.\" \n\nStarMobile was recently named a \"Cool Vendor in Mobile App Development, 2015\u2033 by Gartner and an Emerging Vendor by CRN.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, are likely to have risen to 5.288 million in July from 5.249 million in the prior month. \n \nSome investors have argued that the recent market volatility will force the U.S. Federal Reserve to wait until the year-end to raise long-term interest rates. \n \nApple (AAPL.O) shares were up 1.2 percent at $113.63 premarket.

Seattle Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer\u2019s interests come together in the club\u2019s Posters by the People program.

In his first season as Sounders FC Director of Community Outreach, Levesque is organizing Seattle\u2019s 30 in 30 campaign. This month, United in Green (Sounders FC\u2019s community arm) is working with the First Team, S2 and former players to provide 30 inspirational experiences to kids and families battling cancer in 30 days. \n \nThe Reign continued their exceptional season with a hard-fought 2-1 win over the Washington Spirit, a preview of the #1 v #4 playoff matchup to come (Sunday 6:30pm at Memorial Stadium,) the exact same first round matchup as last year.\u00a0 Notable in the game was some drama from the sideline , as Seattle owner Bill Predmore was at the Reign bench despite it being explicitly against the NWSL rules for him to be there, refusing to leave when asked to do so and reportedly throwing an organizing volunteer\u2019s phone as a part of the scene. \n MLS  \nIn case you somehow missed it, Drogba\u2019s here and debuted in dramatic fashion, simultaneously ending Chicago\u2019s season while keeping Montreal\u2019s alive ,\u00a0scoring a hat trick on his debut, including the equalizer and game-winner within 5 minutes. A particularly bitter end for Chicago, who after missing out on Jermaine Jones last year now will likely watch another transfer target help another Conference rival into the playoffs.

First of all, I congratulate you. \n \nThe day is celebrated in the memory of those leaders who rendered innumerable sacrifices for the liberty of the nation from shackles of slavery. It was their untiring struggle and perseverance which delivered the fruit of independence for the Muslims of the subcontinent. The Muslims of the subcontinent followed the call of the Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the dream of a new homeland became a reality at a time when it seemed almost impossible to win it. \n \nPakistan was created for lofty ideals. To win freedom was the first step in that direction. The real freedom means achieving the goal of becoming a self-reliant nation - one that is able to guard her interests and promote her values. Freedom will really be freedom only when we follow the principles taught by our founding fathers and remain united in confronting the challenges the country faces in its move towards growth shared by all Pakistanis. \n \nIt is our collective responsibility to play our roles to transform Pakistan into a strong, prosperous and thriving country. This may require some sacrifices on our part but if we keep the principles taught by our great leaders in mind, we will have the vision to see that such sacrifices effect great advancement for the future of a nation. \n \nA strong economic system based on strong institutions is the key to progress. No nation can hope to grow without a robust financial system and powerful economy. Despite challenges Pakistan managed established a central bank and a viable economic system early on. Although our economy has had many rises and falls and has sometimes seen crises, I believe there is still enormous potential for growth and the economy is now headed in the right direction. \n \nOn this auspicious occasion the State Bank is launching its five-year Strategic Plan. We have titled this Plan SBP Vision 2020. The Plan has devised by the management and officers of the SBP after months of ceaseless work. SBP Vision 2020 has been developed through a participative and consultative process. SBP took the Vision 2025 into account. Moreover, as a part of the process, surveys were conducted of external stakeholders. The results of these surveys were combined with a global scan of central banking issues and domestic and global economic and financial developments. \n \nOur aim is for SBP to be a role model for corporate best practices in Pakistan and to deliver effective and efficient outcomes at every level. We need to empower all staff members to help deliver SBP Vision 2020 and drive the organization's change. In this respect, our core values of Integrity, Accountability, Teamwork, Courage, Excellence and Result orientation shall be the focus for further inculcation into the SBP culture. \n \nSBP Vision 2020 organizes activities around the six strategic imperatives which include: enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy; strengthening the financial system stability regime; improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and fairness of the banking system; increasing financial inclusion; developing modern and robust payments systems; and strengthening SBP's organizational efficiency and effectiveness. \n \nAround 50 percent of Pakistan's adult population has no access to financial services such as formal savings, payments, deposits, credit or insurance. Despite efforts, the level of financial inclusion has remained very low, and the need for a new comprehensive national strategy has been recognized. Following extensive development and consultation, the National Financial Inclusion Strategy was launched in May 2015. \n \nSBP Vision 2020 with respect to increasing financial inclusion is closely linked to implementation of the NFIS. The NFIS creates the foundation for SBP, the Government and private sector to implement a comprehensive set of coherent and sequenced reforms needed to make a meaningful impact on financial inclusion in Pakistan. The NFIS will guide efforts to promote financial inclusion over the coming five years. \n \nApart from its core functions, the SBP is playing an important in preserving the cultural heritage of the country. In this regard, State Bank Museum and Art Gallery has a prominent role. In a very short span of time the State Bank Museum has become the member of International Forums such as International Council of Museums and Commonwealth Association of Museums. As an ongoing drive State Bank has taken another pioneering initiative by inviting private collectors to be part of SBP Museum, by donating or selling their collections, which will be preserved professionally under an ideal environment, not only this but depending on the size and type of the collection, SBP Museum will reserve a corner, or show space in the name of the donor. \n \nI am very pleased to see the positive response of the citizens and collectors. I am pleased to welcome Pakistan's renowned artist Mr. Adil Salahuddin who has donated a valuable collection to State Bank. It gives me immense pleasure to acknowledge the contribution of Mr. Adil Salahuddin, who is recipient of Sitara-e-Imtiaz and President's Pride of Performance award. He played an important role in the design process of stamps and currency notes in Pakistan as well as abroad. \n \nSBP is launching the collection of Mr. Adil Salahuddin on this auspicious occasion of our Independence Day. \n \nAt the end, I would like to say that the State Bank of Pakistan is one of the few institutions that are the pride of the country. In spite of hazards and challenges, it has made great strides towards the goal of taking the economy to new heights. Our vibrant banking industry is an example of the unremitting efforts that the past and present employees of the SBP have been making. We still have a long way to move forward. There are many, many milestones that remain for us to conquer. \n \nLet us make a firm resolve today that we will live up to the ideals of the Quaid-e-Azam and further our efforts to achieve the ends for which the State Bank of Pakistan was established.","title":"03Sep\/Ashraf Mahmood Wathra: Strengthening Pakistan's economy and financial services","media-type":"News","source":"Bank for International Settlements","published":"2015-09-03T07:14:00Z"}

We\u2019re @FairfaxMoney \n\nTaxi drivers have been protesting in Melbourne this morning but the anger is felt by the taxi industry across the country. Some drivers say that they find it hard to compete with ride-sharing in their own cars. And investors who have put their life savings into owning taxi plates have seen their stakes shrink.\n\nBut despite the protests, Uber is bullish about its operations.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"The leaders of these protests are taxi investors, not drivers.\"\n\n\"These same investors are the ones who have kept drivers' wages low and working conditions poor for decades before Uber arrived.\n\n\"Instead of improving their own business, these plate owners are blaming others,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nUber is not to blame for taxi drivers' poor working conditions and taxi industry data shows that \"the taxi market has grown since Uber arrived,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOne Brisbane taxi driver, Ross, who recently contacted Money, said he gets upset with ride-sharing because people do not understand the costs that go into a taxi.\n\nThere are the cameras that taxis have to have and car insurance of $6000 a year and \"security\" fees of $600 a year. And that is before the taxi driver put the keys into the ignition.\n\nHe said he has just put a new Toyota Aurion on the road at a cost of $46,000 and in Brisbane you see old Corollas being used for ride-sharing.\n\nAn older reader from NSW who does not want to be identified said he and his wife bought a taxi plate so that they would not have to go on to the pension.\n\nBut the value of the investment has fallen due to ride-sharing.\n\nThe retirees first bought a taxi plate in 2006 and it was worth about $440,000 in 2008.

These are 5 mobile game marketing strategies to reduce UA cost, attract players and grow revenue organically. \n\nUser acquisition can be a lot like that head contraption from Saw.\n\nIn the mobile game industry, paid advertising techniques on mobile devices, such as mobile ad networks, are what's typically known as user acquisition or UA.\n\nIt's the standard way to monetize mobile games.\n\nThe problem is user acquisition cost is high and rising.\n\nAnd because of that, mobile game developers seem to be either closing up shop or desperately looking for ways to reduce their user acquisition cost before they have to.\n\nThe math is simple.\n\nFor a mobile game to stay profitable its user acquisition cost has to stay below its customer lifetime value (CLV).\n\nAnd I'm absolutely hell-bent on helping mobile game developers reduce user acquisition cost.\n\nThat said, here are 5 actionable, mobile game marketing strategies that I want you to execute to reduce user acquisition cost, attract players and grow revenue organically...\n\nIf you're like most developers, you've got an email newsletter on your website because you know it's important, but it's also kind of a nuisance, right?\n\nYou might not have a ton of addresses so it's not super exciting to try and figure out what to send each week. And because of that, maybe you haven't sent anything in a while.\n\nNot good.\n\nEmail is 40x better at acquiring new customers than Facebook and Twitter combined.\n\nSo here's what I want you to do...\n\nStart investing in an \n\nYour offer could be an exclusive origin story, a PDF comic book or some type of in-game promo code.\n\nIn any case, it has to be something valuable enough for your audience to fork over their email addresses.\n\nIt all sounds very simple, but if you start doing this your email list will become one the best ways to grow revenue organically and reduce user acquisition cost.\n\nDoes this sound familiar? You've got an official website for your game, and it takes a lot of time and money to manage for what feels like very little return on investment.\n\nIts primary function has really become information or PR, rather than marketing or selling games.\n\nIf that sounds familiar then you're missing a giant opportunity to generate revenue.\n\nSo, here's what I want you to do...\n\nConvert all your official game websites into landing pages (or squeeze pages), because that's going to improve clicks through to your marketplaces.\n\nIf you're not sure how to do that please read my official game website design strategy.\n\nFollow that guide all the way through, start growing revenue with your official game websites and start relinquishing your dependency on paid advertising.\n\nLet's say you're a F2P mobile game with IAPs, and you're using mobile ad networks to monetize. That's the common mobile game business model.\n\nBut what inevitably happens is this...\n\nYou're going to get jealous of all the players those networks are sucking right out of your game. Your retention rate will drop and your IAP revenue will follow.\n\nYou'll be left making the vast majority of money by sending players away from your games.\n\nUser acquisition is a lot like that head contraption from Saw.\n\nAnd there's a lot of mobile game developers struggling to get out of it.\n\nHere's what helps unlock that...\n\nInstead of relying 100% on mobile ad networks to monetize your games implement native advertising with the goal of increasing IAPs.\n\nFor example, let's say your game is Super Mario Bros 3 and a player finds a magic flute. They should see a 3-tier, native advertisement asking them which world they'd like to warp to and at what cost.\n\nRolling your own native advertising is one of the best ways for F2P mobile games to grow revenue and reduce user acquisition cost. \n\n400 million people around the world use Dropbox, the standard in cloud storage accessible from any device anywhere. But I don't want to talk about storage.\n\nI want to talk about those 400 million users.\n\nIn the startup world, that's unbelievable. And it's a known fact Dropbox spent very little on advertising.\n\nSo, how'd they do it?\n\nThey did it with incentivized referrals.\n\nWhen you sign up for a free Dropbox account you get 2 GB of storage. But if you refer it to a friend and they sign up too, Dropbox adds another 500 MB to your account.\n\nAnd I want you to do the same type of thing for your games. It's called an incentivized referral program.\n\nYou've no doubt a reward system in your game. Utilize that system to leverage referrals from your players because that'll encourage organic shares, expanding your audience at a rapid pace.\n\nMarketing channels are places online where you talk about or post content about your games, such as websites, forums, social media and email newsletters.\n\nAnd every day you post new content in those channels such as screenshots, memes, trailers, video, articles, interviews and so on.\n\nThe problem is, everyone's basically getting the same information about your games wherever they go.\n\nNothing's exclusive.\n\nSo, here's what I want you to do\u2026\n\nReserve big content reveals for only certain marketing channels.\n\nFor example, what if Twitter was the only place online where people could see new screenshots of your game? Here's what you might post in other channels to encourage followers...\n\nWant to see our game before anyone else? Follow us on Twitter where every Saturday we post 3 exclusive, never-before-seen screenshots of [game]!\n\nThis strategy immediately does three things:\n\nIt increases your social audience because people have an incentive (1). It increases the value of your content because it's exclusive (2). And it increases total shares because your audience will want to be the person who shares it for you (3).\n\nContent exclusivity is a powerful strategy for building an audience and reducing user acquisition cost.\n\nUser acquisition, or paid advertising techniques on mobile devices, isn't the only way to sell mobile games.\n\nDon't buy into the lie, literally or figuratively.\n\nThere are dozens of ways to reduce user acquisition cost. And when you start taking into account your specific game's experience, there's exponentially more.\n\nPut my 5 mobile game marketing strategies in place, measure them and then post a comment below or email me privately \n\nJustin Carroll runs Monastery, a mobile game marketing agency that's hell-bent on helping mobile game developers reduce user acquisition cost.

He was also an England under 18 squad member.\u00a0 \n\nSpeaking about what he remembers of his accident, Matt told Express.co.uk: \"I don\u2019t remember much of the accident itself. We had a tough training session, ahead of the Friday when we were due to play the Scots.\u00a0 \n\n\"We went into live scrummaging. I remember hitting the scrum and the scrum collapsing, with me left at the bottom. I said 'I can\u2019t breathe! I can\u2019t breathe!' I was really worried, and realised couldn\u2019t feel my arms and legs. After that I blacked out.\" \n\nHe added: \"I remember waking up in the ambulance and the paramedics were cutting my England shirt off me. The only thing I was thinking was, 'That\u2019s my England shirt! Don\u2019t damage that!' I drifted in and out of consciousness with really frightening dreams.\u00a0 \n\n\"In between the dreams, I\u2019d wake up in Stoke Mandeville Hospital ward, seeing my family standing around me.\" \n\nLittle did Matt know his England shirt being ripped open was about to be the last of his worries - when the scrum collapsed it dislocated his neck, severing his spinal cord.\u00a0 \n\n\"Initially, it was difficult to come to terms with,\" he said. \"I had quite a few dark days. \n\n\"Going from being a young, fit sportsman, to not being able to move from the neck down was tough.\u00a0 \n\n\"The thing that was great for me was the support from my amazing family and friends. They didn\u2019t treat me any differently to before \u2013 to them I was just the same old Matt.\" \n\nSpeaking about being in hospital, he added: \"You don\u2019t think life is ever going to be the same again. Stoke Mandeville for me wasn\u2019t a very pleasant place.\u00a0 \n\n\"There were great people in there, who will be friends of mine for life; but some weren\u2019t as great. \n\n\"There was so much emotion going through my mind, but they didn\u2019t explain what was happening to me. They made you feel like a lump of meat, not a normal person \u2013 whatever normal is.\u00a0 \n\n\"I didn\u2019t have much support at Stoke Mandeville. I couldn\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel at times. It was tough.\" \n\nThis year marks a decade since the accident, which left Matt paralysed and a tetraplegic, dependent on a ventilator to breath.\u00a0 \n\nShowing incredible strength, tranquility and mental power, the former rugby star hasn't let his injuries consume him.\u00a0 \n\nIn fact, if anything Matt is stronger than ever and opening a new centre in Melton Mowbray to inspire children and their families to continue fighting after suffering a catastrophic injury.\u00a0 \n\nBut none of this would be as easy without his friends and former team mates helping him and giving their undying support.\u00a0 \n\nMatt explained: \"My old teammates are a still a massive part of my life, as well as of the Matt Hampson Foundation. They support me in everything I do.\u00a0 \n\n\"One of my best mates, Matt Cornwall, who was England Under 21\u2019s captain and is now team manager at Leicester Tigers, is a great guy and has constantly been a really positive influence.\u00a0 \n\n\"Then there are guys like James Haskell, Ben Foden, Toby Flood and others who I was playing alongside, who are always there for me and stay in touch. Rugby\u2019s a big family \u2013 you go to the same events and functions.\" \n\nHe added: \"Richard Cockerill once said to me that I\u2019ll always be a Leicester Tiger, and that they will support me for the rest of my life. What a fantastic club to do that. I\u2019m a life-member of the Tigers, and they help with everything I do, especially with the Foundation. It means a great deal to me.\" \n\nMatt is now focusing all his efforts on the Get Busy Living Centre. He said: \"I think it will be a really important place for people to come and share positive experiences with their families. We have so many different beneficiaries; so many unique talents.\u00a0 \n\n\"The Foundation can do amazing things with this new Centre, and it gives us a real focal-point.\" \n\nHe added: \"My attitude is that you need to live your life every day. You can\u2019t sit still and wait to be helped. You need to live every day, and try to achieve something every day.\u00a0 \n\n\"That\u2019s how I feel. Like we say at the Foundation, we want to Get Busy Living. That\u2019s the whole point of the Foundation \u2013 it\u2019s about being proactive, to do something productive with your life.\"","title":"'I was screaming \"I can't breathe!\"'  Tetraplegic rugby star Matt Hampson speaks out","media-type":"News","source":"Daily Express","published":"2015-09-28T15:01:00Z"}

Each time he sidestepped the question, despite having ruled out putting combat boots on the ground in the past.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr Abbott said the campaign of air strikes against Islamic State had been effective but then added: \"As to what might happen in the long-term future, it's just not appropriate to speculate today. But we are continuing to work with our partners and allies to ensure that the response is prudent, proportionate and effective.\"\n\nShortly afterwards, in an interview with Sky News, Defence Minister Kevin Andrews was asked twice about boots on the ground. The first time, he did not directly answer the question but when asked a second time he said: \"We're not contemplating boots on the ground.\"\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Australia could consider putting combat troops into Iraq or Syria without a similar commitment from the United States. There has been no suggestion from Washington that the administration of President Barack Obama is considering such a move.\n\nWhen Mr Abbott was asked a year ago on Channel Seven's Sunrise program how far Australia would go in the battle against Islamic State, he replied: I certainly don't rule out further military involvement but I do rule out combat troops on the ground.\"\n\nHe has said repeatedly this year that the Iraqis do not want Western combat troops in their country and that such a move cannot be made without their consent.\n\nSending troops into Syria is even harder to contemplate as it could be regarded as an act of war by the regime of the dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nMr Andrews also revealed that RAAF Hornet jet fighters could go into Syria as far as Islamic State's de facto capital of Raqqa, about 200 kilometres across the border.\n\nBut he said they would not fly further than that into western Syria, where the Assad regime has air defences.\n\nFollow us on Twitter The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"Islamic State: Tony Abbott refuses to rule ...","media-type":"News","source":"Bendigo Advertiser","published":"2015-09-09T04:45:39Z"}

All times local (CET): \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n4:25 p.m. \n \nTwo ferries chartered by Greece are carrying more than 4,000 migrants from its overwhelmed eastern Aegean islands to the mainland. \n \nThe ferries are to arrive in Piraeus, the main port near Athens, later Tuesday night. The government began the ferry runs from islands such as Lesbos and Kos in mid-August due to a scarcity of tickets on regular ferries at the height of the summer tourist season. \n \nThousands of migrants have been stuck on the Greek islands, with families sleeping out in the open for days in streets and parks until they can get a ferry ticket to Piraeus. \n \nIn addition, Greece's coast guard says it rescued nearly 1,200 migrants from the sea off the islands in the last 24 hours. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n3:50 p.m. \n \nThe chief of Frontex, the European Union's border agency, says trafficking in fake Syrian passports has increased, notably in Turkey, creating a windfall for criminal gangs and a boon for migrants trying to get into Europe. \n \nFrontex chief Fabrice Leggeri said Tuesday that Syrians fleeing their country's civil war have the right to asylum in EU nations, making a Syrian passport very attractive. He told France's Europe 1 radio the situation is also \"extremely lucrative for criminal organizations.\" \n \nHe said those who purchase a fake Syrian passport are Arabic speaking, making them credible, but usually have a \"profile of an economic immigrant\" who, under European rules, would not receive asylum. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n3:10 p.m. \n \nThe fifth suspect in the deaths of 71 migrants found in a truck on the highway to Vienna last week has been placed under preliminary arrest for up to 30 days. \n \nThe court in the central Hungarian city of Kecskemet made the ruling Tuesday. \n \nThe 24-year-old Bulgarian man, along with three other Bulgarians and one Afghan already in custody, is suspected of cooperating in human trafficking. \n \nAuthorities say the migrants suffocated in the truck. Since then, both Austria and Hungary have stepped up efforts to crack down on possible smugglers. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n1:50 p.m. \n \nHungary, one of the hardest-hit nations in Europe's immigration crisis, says over 156,000 migrants have entered this year. \n \nThe Interior Ministry, which gave the numbers Tuesday, say around 142,000 people have requested asylum, including 45,000 migrants from Syria. \n \nHungarian officials have shut down the main international train station in Budapest, halting all trains Tuesday as police cleared out hundreds of migrants at the station. Chaos has ensued, with the migrants chanting \"Freedom! Freedom!\" and demanding to use the train tickets they bought to go to Austria and Germany. \n \nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban will meet with top EU officials on Thursday in Brussels about the crisis, including EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, EU Council President Donald Tusk , and European Parliament President Martin Schulz. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n1:40 p.m. \n \nThe European Court of Human Rights has upheld the case of three Tunisian migrants expelled from Italy in 2011 in the wake of the Arab Spring uprising. \n \nThe court ruled Tuesday they had been subjected to degrading and inhuman treatment during four days in an Italian detention center, suffered a collective expulsion and could not challenge their forced return home. The Strasbourg-based court ordered Italy to pay 10,000 euros ($11,215) in damages to each, plus more for costs. \n \nThe court said it took into account the overcrowding at the southern Italian island of Lampedusa as Tunisians and others \u2014 about 55,300 of them \u2014 fled their countries after the Tunisian revolution. Still, it said, there could be no skirting the prohibition against inhuman treatment. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n1:30 p.m. \n \nBavaria has opened Germany's first reception center meant to house only migrants from southeastern Europe, part of an effort to deal more quickly with people flooding in from the Balkans whose chances of being allowed to stay are minimal. \n \nThe center at a former barracks near Ingolstadt opened Tuesday and is meant to accommodate 500 migrants. The state's social affairs minister, Emilia Mueller, said authorities at the center will try to process asylum claims within six weeks. \n \nGermany has been trying to stem an influx of arrivals this year from countries such as Kosovo, Albania and Serbia, who have virtually no chance of being granted asylum \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n12:55 p.m. \n \nThe small boy was lost, separated from his family in the chaos as police tried to clear out migrants from Budapest's main train station. \n \nLuckily Baba Mujhse, a Egyptian-Hungarian-Jewish volunteer helping migrants at the Keleti train terminal, was there to help Tuesday. \n \nThe 6-foot-6 Arabic-speaking textile designer held the boy in his arms as tried to calm scores of migrants who police banned from getting on the trains to Austria and Germany. The migrants had spent hundreds of euros (dollars) on the tickets but police say they did not have valid travel documents. \n \n\"This is crazy,\" Baba said as his eyes scanned the crowd in search of the young boy's family. \"This is not a solution to anything,\" he added, referring to the travel ban. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n12:40 p.m. \n \nCzech police detained an unusually large number of migrants \u2014 214 \u2014 on trains coming from Hungary and Austria at the border town of Breclav on Monday night. \n \nThe migrants included 115 men, 38 women and 61 children, mostly from Syria, most on a train heading from Budapest to Berlin. \n \nPolice spokeswoman Katerina Rendlova said most of the migrants didn't have proper documents, including permission to enter Czech territory, so they were detained and will be sent to the country's migrant centers. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n12:30 p.m. \n \nSpain's conservative prime minister says his country is open to spreading out arriving refugees among the European Union's 28 nations, but isn't committing to take in more than the 2,739 it already has pledged to accept. \n \nPrime Minister Mariano Rajoy spoke Tuesday after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country has taken more migrants than any other EU country and wants quotas to spread them out more evenly. Germany expects 800,000 migrants this year. \n \nRajoy said there can be no progress on the migrant dilemma until better migrant processing centers are built in Greece and Italy. Asked whether Madrid would accept compulsory migrant quotas, he said \"we want to see the criteria,\" which should include factors such as a country's unemployment rate. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n12:20 p.m. \n \nMohammed, a 24-year-old economist from the Syrian city of Aleppo, says the chaos at Budapest's Keleti train station is the worst he has seen since leaving Syria. \n \nHungary on Tuesday suspended all rail traffic from that station and cleared it of hundreds of migrants trying to board trains for Austria and Germany after scuffles broke out. \n \nMohammed said he bought a ticket to Munich for 200 euros ($225) after Hungarian police told him Monday night that they would be allowed to leave. Despite showing a Syrian passport to police guarding the platform, they told him Tuesday he could not go through because he did not have a visa for Germany. \n \nHe refused to give his last name to an AP reporter because of concerns about his family still in Aleppo. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n12 noon \n \nTensions are flaring once again at Greece's northern border with Macedonia, where about 1,500 migrants are waiting to cross the border and head north toward the more prosperous European Union countries. \n \nFights and scuffles broke out Tuesday among the crowd near the Greek village of Idomeni when hundreds of people, mainly from Afghanistan and Pakistan, attempted to rush the border being guarded by Macedonian police. \n \nMacedonian authorities have been allowing small groups to cross at a time and head to the Gevgelija train station. Last month, Macedonian authorities briefly halted all crossings and used stun grenades and batons to push back the crowd. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n11:45 a.m. \n \nChancellor Angela Merkel says Germany isn't to blame for the stream of Syrian refugees in Hungary trying to board trains headed for Germany. \n \nHungary's government has pinpointed Germany's \"more flexible attitude\" toward Syrians as a problem that encourages migration. German authorities have advised officials not to send Syrians back to the first European Union country where they arrived, as EU rules stipulate. \n \nMerkel said Tuesday that Syrians do have a high chance of getting asylum but \"that should be no surprise ... and should actually be similar in every European country.\" \n \nMerkel said \"the current rules are clearly not being practiced.\" She said the answer is a common European asylum policy with a \"fair distribution\" of refugees across the 28-nation EU. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n11:20 a.m. \n \nHungary has suspended all rail traffic from its main terminal in Budapest and cleared the train station of hundreds of migrants trying to board trains for Austria and Germany after scuffles broke out where a train was to leave for Vienna and Munich. \n \nMigrants chanting \"Freedom! Freedom!\" congregated outside the station after being pushed out. \n \nPolice acted after authorities announced over station loudspeakers that all trains would be stopped from leaving for an indefinite period. Scores of locals, tourists and migrants with travel documents and tickets remained in the cavernous station, some staring at information boards still showing arrival and departure times. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n10:55 a.m. \n \nUNICEF says the number of women and children fleeing through Macedonia has tripled in the past three months. \n \nThe U.N.'s children's agency said Tuesday some 3,000 people are passing daily through the former Yugoslav republic \u2014 and roughly one in eight is a pregnant woman. Citing Macedonian figures, UNICEF says four out of five of the migrants come from Syria. \n \nSince June, more than 52,000 people have been registered in the town of Gevgelija on the Greek border. The agency says it is dispatching sending water and huge tents to Skopje, the Macedonian capital. \n \n\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \n10:45 a.m. \n \nGreece's coast guard says it has rescued nearly 1,200 migrants from the sea off its eastern Aegean islands in a single day, as the flood of people fleeing war and poverty to seek shelter in the European Union continues unabated. \n \nThe coast guard said Tuesday it had picked up 1,192 people in 31 separate search-and-rescue operations from Monday morning to Tuesday morning off the islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Agathonissi, Farmakonissi, Kos and Megisti. That number is significantly higher than the average of late, which is usually in the hundreds. \n \nThe numbers do not include hundreds more who reach the islands themselves from the nearby Turkish coast each day, usually in overloaded inflatable dinghies.","title":"The Latest: Greek Ferries Carry 4,000 Migrants to Mainland","media-type":"News","source":"ABC News","published":"2015-09-01T14:36:45Z"}

{"id":"33b54601-97db-41c4-8659-d94855ca25d4","content":"The country's crude oil exploitation output this year is estimated to reach 17.58 million tonnes, up 4.6 per cent against the government's annual target, according to the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). \n\nThe ministry also made a forecast that the crude oil output next year would decline to 16.03 million tonnes, a fall of 8.8 % against this year's figure.\n\nDespite the rise in output, crude oil exports will contribute less to the State budget next time than in the previous years since prices fell sharply in the world market. The export price of crude oil, which contributes roughly 10 % to the total State budget revenue, in the first eight months of the year averaged only US$60 per barrel while the State budget estimates were approved on the basis of the then projected crude oil price of $100 per barrel.\n\nAccording to a forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), oil price in Q3 this year will hover around US$48.16 per barrel after inching up to US$49.16 in Q4 this year.\n\nThe average price will be $51 per barrel this year and $50.36 next year.\n\nAccording to Luong Van Khoi, head of the Centre for Socio-Economic Information and Forecast's World Economic Department under the Ministry of Planning and Investment, world oil prices will depend on the market supply and demand sources while chances of global economic recovery remain slim.\n\nStatistics from the Ministry of Finance showed that the country's revenue from crude oil exports in the first eight months of this year dropped by more than 34 % against the same period last year to only VND47.1 trillion ($2.09 billion).\n\nHot and cold\n\nHowever, experts said the crude oil price reduction in the global market would have both negative and positive effect on Vietnam's economy.\n\nAccording to Khoi, if oil price stays at US$50 per barrel and the devaluation of China's yuan and Vietnam's dong stays at 3 % each, Vietnam's economic growth will be up by 0.03 percentage points this year. Exports will also rise by 0.2 percentage points while imports will drop by 0.08 percentage points this year.However, the country's economic growth will come down by 0.15 percentage points next year, Khoi estimated. In case oil is priced at $40 per barrel and the devaluation of the yuan and the dong is also at 3 %, Vietnam's economic growth will be reduced by 0.45 percentage points this year and 0.58 percentage points next year, Khoi said, adding that the State budget revenue will be cut by VND2 trillion ($88.88 million) this year and VND13 trillion ($577.77 million) in 2016 as per these projections.\n\nHowever, Khoi said, if Vietnam can capitalise on opportunities from the oil price reduction to boost its domestic production by helping local producers cut input costs, revenue from corporate income tax will increase significantly, thus offsetting losses from reduced crude oil export revenue.\n\nIf the country can do that, Khoi said, Vietnam's economic growth would fall by only 0.03 percentage points this year before adding 0.34 percentage points next year.\n\nIn fact, the State budget revenue from local sources increased sharply in the first eight months, reaching VND459.45 trillion ($20.42 billion), up 16.5 % against the same period last year.\n\nAccording to Khoi, if oil prices hovered around $30 per barrel and the devaluation of the yuan and the dong is at 3 %, Vietnam's economic growth this year will drop by 0.95 percentage points, while next year it will drop by 1.08 percentage points. In this case, Vietnam's economy will also fall into a deflation with a rate of -0.3 % in 2015 and -0.6 % in 2016.\n\nThe State budget revenue in this case will also be reduced by VND5 trillion ($222.22 million) in 2015 and VND25 trillion ($1.11 billion) in 2016, Khoi said.\n\nHowever, economic growth will come down by only 0.02 percentage points in 2015 and then rise by 0.26 percentage points in 2016 if the country can capitalise on falling oil prices, Khoi estimates. \n\nVNS","title":"Vietnam's oil output seen rising 4.6%","media-type":"News","source":"VietNamNet Bridge","published":"2015-09-11T02:54:36Z"}

In a one-year period, comprising the months leading up to and following the announcement, oil prices have dropped from more that $100 per barrel to nearly $45 today. \n \nThe drop shook the international oil markets and caused concerns to many, including Iran\u2019s oil-exporting neighbours in the GCC, whose status in the market could be shaken when Iran\u2019s huge oil and gas supply gushes through once the sanctions get lifted. \n \nApart from the oil and gas industry, however, businesses from the GCC and those operating in it, have welcomed the deal. \n \nIran \u2013 with its population of 77 million, is regarded as a huge untapped market, in need of investments of all kinds. \n \n\u201cIran is ready for infrastructure development. The country is hungry for investments and needs to build refineries, roads, hospitals, etc.,\u201d says international sanctions lawyer Sarosh Zaiwalla, whose high profile clients include Bank Mellat, Bank Tejarat and Petropars. \n \nOne of the first non-oil sectors expected to penetrate the Iranian market and be among the first beneficiaries is real estate, especially hospitality . \n \n\u201cAccording to industry sources, while there are more than 1,100 hotels in the country [Iran], only 130 properties belong to the 3- or 4-star segment and many of the existing hotels are in need of renovation and refurbishment. The cities definitely need more mid-market, business-friendly hotels,\u201d Laurent A. Voivenel, CEO of Hotel Management Holdings (HMH) Hotel Group, tells Aficionado . \n \nHMH is a Dubai-based hotel management group that recently announced that it is exploring opportunities for long-term partnerships in Iran. \n \n\u201cWe are already in serious talks with various developers and will be soon visiting the country to take our discussions forward,\u201d Voivenel says. \n \nHMH was founded in 2003 and currently operates several hotel brands in different market segments across 15 cities in the MENA region. \n \nOne of HMH\u2019s unique aspects is offering a dry (alcohol-free) environment, as none of the hotels managed by the group offer any alcohol to the guests, a feature that would suit Iran\u2019s conservative system. \n \n\u201cBeing a pioneer in creating the first and \u2018still the only\u2019 alcohol-free chain of hotels in the Middle East, HMH is the region\u2019s largest group to operate in the dry segment,\u201d Viovenel says. \n \n\u201cToday, we are the strongest player in the \u2018halal-friendly\u2019 segment in the Middle East and North Africa and hold 50 percent [of the region\u2019s] market share in the segment,\u201d he adds, explaining that there are only a handful of operators in the dry segment, but HMH is a market leader. \n \nBesides the obvious need for business -friendly hotels to host the volumes of business delegates visiting the country, the Iranian government is focused on a tourism boom as well. \n \nIran\u2019s government has reportedly set a goal of attracting 20 million tourists by 2025. The country has a wide array of cultural and religious tourism attractions. Some of these are UNESCO World Heritage sites such as the Meidan Imam and Persian Garden in Esfahan, the Golestan Palace in Tehran, and the Persepolis near Shiraz, among several others. \n \n\u201cTehran, Esfahan, Persepolis, Mashhad and Shiraz are some of the cities we are looking at currently,\u201d Voivenel notes. \n \n\u2018Unknown territory\u2019 \n \nInternational and regional hotel brands of different segments, such as Jumeirah Group, have vaguely spoken about their interest in the Iranian market, with no plans or projects being officially announced \n \nAficionado has sent inquiries to numerous hospitality brands, asking about their potential plans for Iran, but we have not received a definitive response. \n \n\u201cWith a long economic and political embargo, Iran is no doubt an unknown territory for many businesses and brands,\u201d Viovenel says. \n \nIt may be this mystery surrounding Iran\u2019s market dynamics that made most businesses hesitant to announce their plans. \n \n\u201cThe first thing the country needs is to have a proper legal and arbitration system, because any investor who brings money to a new country wants to make sure his investment is safe,\u201d Zaiwalla notes. \n \n\u201cTherefore, it is imperative to have an international arbitration system, with an independent tribunal. Iran will have to change its laws to make sure that an arbitration awarded against a party in Iran is enforced by courts in the country,\u201d he adds. \n \nHowever, this was not the case with HMH. \u201cWe at HMH believe that Iran is a very safe destination that holds excellent business and tourism opportunities. Assuming that there are no major turnarounds on the existing nuclear deal, it will certainly flourish as a country and emerge as an economic power,\u201d Viovenel concludes. \n\r \r \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\r \r \r \r \nShare This Article \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\r \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\r \r \ntags \n\r \nDubai Esfahan hospitality hotel Iran Jumeirah Group Jumeirah Hospitality luxury hospitaltiy tourism \n \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\r \r \n\n\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\r \r \n \n\r Tommy Hilfiger launches Fall\/Winter collection in Middle East \r \nRead More \n\r \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r \r \r \r\n \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\r \r\n \t\t\t\t\t\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\r \r \r More On Business \r \r \r \r  BASELWORLD OPENS \r \nRead More \n\r \r \r \r \r  New iMac launches in UAE \r \nRead More \n\r \r \r \r \r  Independents find niche in a difficult Swiss watches market \r \nRead More \n\r \r \r \u00a0  \r \r  Finding opportunity in struggling Puerto Rico hotels \r \nRead More \n\r \r \r \r \r  Samsung struggles with Chinese suppliers \r \nRead More \n\r \r \r \r \r  Arab Luxury World 2014: Innovation drives luxury in the Middle East \r \nRead More \n\r \r \r \r \r  Apple Unveils iOS 7 \r \nRead More \n\r \r \r \u00a0 \r \r \nRead More On Business","title":"Region\u2019s hoteliers first in line for Iran","media-type":"News","source":"Aficionado","published":"2015-09-06T13:08:28Z"}
{"id":"a723bc65-2c0f-4042-98d4-6c85509ddb55","content":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Pope Francis is on Capitol Hill to make history Thursday by becoming the first pontiff to address a joint meeting of Congress in a speech that\u2019s expected to challenge lawmakers on some of the most divisive issues in American politics. \n \nIn another gesture designed to make politicians uncomfortable, Francis won\u2019t follow his speech with a lavish meal with lawmakers. Instead, he\u2019ll go directly to a lunch with homeless people helped by Catholic charities. \n \nOn the third day of his visit to the United States, Francis, the first Jesuit pope, is expected to return to themes contained in his blunt address on the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday, in which he tackled climate change, immigration, the need to respect religious liberty and President Barack Obama\u2019s opening to Cuba. \n \nMany of his views will likely clash with the entrenched partisan positions on Capitol Hill, where Republicans control both the House and the Senate. But he could put Democrats on the spot as well if he weighs in on abortion \u2014 an issue that will come up for a vote in the Senate later Thursday \u2014 and if he calls for traditional marriage to be protected. \n \nFrancis emerged from the residence of the Vatican\u2019s ambassador to Washington on Thursday morning and greeted well wishers, including large numbers of children, waiting outside, before climbing into his now familiar Fiat hatchback car to travel to the U.S. Capitol. \n \nHe was greeted by Republican House Speaker John Boehner, a practicing Catholic, who was seen pacing in his office as he waited for the Pope. The Speaker greeted the pontiff with the words \u201cYour Holiness, welcome.\u201d \n \nLawmakers were already gathering in the House of Representatives to hear how directly he would address contentious political issues. The Argentine-born Pope introduced himself Wednesday at the White House as the \u201cson of an immigrant family,\u201d making clear his deep personal connection to an issue that has opened up bitter fault lines in the 2016 presidential race and within the Republican Party. \n \nFrancis will give his speech from the House of Representatives, with Boehner and Vice President Joe Biden sitting behind him. Francis is expected to greet crowds following an appearance on the Speaker\u2019s Balcony. \n \nChief Justice John Roberts, a devout Catholic, will attend the address, as will Supreme Court Justices Anthony Kennedy and Sonia Sotomayor, who also are Catholic. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is Jewish, will be in the audience, too. \n \nRepublican presidential candidates Ben Carson and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will also be in the House chamber. \n \nOn Wednesday, Francis signaled that he was ready to engage in politics as well as ministering to the Catholic Church\u2019s 70 million U.S. believers. \n \nHe told Obama it was \u201cencouraging\u201d the President was committed to battling climate change, saying the planet was at a \u201ccritical moment in history.\u201d \n \nHe also said that men and women of goodwill should redouble efforts to support the world\u2019s most vulnerable people, in comments seen as pushing his vision of a more inclusive vision of global capitalism. \n \nBut in a sign of disagreement with the president, Francis also visited nuns belonging to the Little Sisters of the Poor order that is currently suing the Obama administration for requiring contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act. \n \nFrancis will travel to New York late Thursday afternoon and will wrap up his six-day visit to the United States in Philadelphia on Sunday.","title":"WATCH LIVE: Pope Francis delivers historic speech to Congress","media-type":"News","source":"WTVR-TV","published":"2015-09-24T14:06:02Z"}

The dead included a 3-year-old boy whose body washed up on a Turkish beach, galvanizing a worldwide debate about migration. \n\nErdogan said: \"It's not just refugees who drown in the Mediterranean, it's humanity, humanity!\" \n\nHe said Turkey was hosting close to 2 million refugees, in contrast to about 200,000 in total being hosted by \"many times more\" prosperous Western countries. \n\n--- \n\n1350 GMT \n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has renewed her call for binding quotas to spread out tens of thousands of migrants among the European Union's 28 countries. \n\nDuring a visit to Switzerland, Merkel said she discussed the issue with French President Francois Hollande on Thursday morning. She said they agree that \"for those who need protection ... we need binding quotas within the European Union to share the task.\" \n\nShe stressed that a country's size and economic strength will be taken into account \"but otherwise we will not cope with this question.\" \n\nGermany has taken in more migrants than any other European Union country. It expects 800,000 new arrivals this year. \n\n--- \n\n1340 GMT \n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says the refugee influx \"is a problem that concerns us all in Europe\" and says her country is doing what is morally necessary. \n\nMerkel was asked Thursday during a visit to Switzerland whether she shared the Hungarian prime minister's opinion that the influx is Germany's problem. \n\nMerkel said: \"Germany is doing what is morally and legally necessary, no more and no less.\" She said Hungary is right to say that the EU's borders have to be better protected and migrants registered \"but of course that's not the end of it.\" \n\nShe added: \"There's also an obligation to give protection to those who deserve protection. And the Geneva Convention on refugees applies not just in Germany, but in every European member.\" \n\n--- \n\n1325 GMT \n\nGreece's caretaker government says its coast guard has been rescuing hundreds of migrants from the sea every day \u2014 sometimes over 1,000 in one day \u2014 despite a severe scarcity of resources. \n\nAlternate Economy Minister Christos Zois said Thursday that 36 percent of the Greek coast guard's 240 vessels were not operational, as were four of its seven aircraft. Only one of its six helicopters is able to fly. \n\nZois said the coast guard was facing difficulties finding funding and spare parts. \n\nGreece has been in the grip of a deep financial crisis for the past five years that has wiped out a quarter of its economy. Successive governments have imposed spending cuts across the board, leaving many state services struggling. \n\n-- \n\n1315 GMT: \n\nFinancially strapped Greece says it needs more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to deal with the current migrant crisis. \n\nThe estimate was given Thursday by the country's caretaker economy minister, Nikos Christodoulakis. Greece says it has seen over 230,000 migrants enter the country this year, most coming by sea to its eastern islands. \n\nHe said for now Greece is completing procedures to get money from nine different European funds, seeking 400 million euros ($445 million) from the asylum fund and 330 million euros ($367 million) from a fund for the poor. \n\n--- \n\n1300 GMT \n\nCanadian Immigration Minister Chris Alexander says the tragic photo of young Aylan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned off the coast of Turkey along with his mother and brother \"broke hearts around the world.\" \n\nThe boy's aunt in Vancouver had applied to sponsor the family, but the application was rejected by Canadian authorities. \n\nAlexander says \"Like all Canadians, I was deeply saddened by that image and of the many other images of the plight of the Syrian and Iraqi migrants fleeing persecution at the hands of ISIS.\" \n\nHe said Canada has one of the most generous per capita immigration and refugee resettlement programs in the world, and was planning to accept 23,000 Iraqis refugees and 11,300 Syrians. \n\n--- \n\n1245 GMT \n\nCanada's immigration minister is suspending his re-election campaign to travel to Ottawa and look into why the Canada government rejected a request to take in the Syrian family whose mother and two young sons drowned this week trying to get to Europe. \n\nA senior government official said Chris Alexander's priority \"is to ascertain the facts of the case.\" \n\nThe photo of a 3-year-old boy who washed up on a beach in Turkey has galvanized a worldwide debate about migration. \n\nA Canadian legislator says he had submitted a request on behalf on the boys' aunt, who had wanted to bring the family to Canada, but was turned down by Canadian immigration officials. \n\n--- \n\n1235 GMT \n\nA senior ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel is rejecting the Hungarian prime minister's assertion that the migrant influx is a German problem. \n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban said the problem is Germany's because so many migrants want to go there. But in Berlin, Volker Kauder, the parliamentary caucus leader of Merkel's conservative bloc, noted that European Union rules say migrants are supposed to be registered in the first EU country where they arrive \u2014 and then stay there. \n\nKauder says \"where people want to go is one thing, but they are registered and they are supposed to stay where they arrive in a safe country in Europe.\" \n\n--- \n\n1200 GMT \n\nScuffles have broken out at the train station in the Hungarian town of Bicske between migrants and police in riot gear. \n\nSeveral hundred migrants excitedly packed into Thursday's first train leaving the Budapest train station, hoping to reach Austria. But when the train stopped on a police-packed platform at Bicske, which hosts a major refugee camp, disappointed migrants started chanting \"No camp!\" and refused to leave the train as police ordered. \n\nSeveral hundred migrants have remained on or beside the idling train at Bicske for hours. Police have distributed water, but many migrants have refused it or thrown it back, fearing it could contain sedatives. \n\nIn Budapest, thousands of migrants remain camped out at Keleti, the main train station. Few agreed to board another train to northwest Hungary, fearing they too will run into another wall of police. \n\n--- \n\n1135 GMT \n\nThe president of the 28-nation European Union is calling for countries to share the burden of taking in at least 100,000 asylum-seekers arriving in the nations hardest hit by the migrant influx: Greece, Italy and Hungary. \n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said Thursday that the \"fair distribution of at least 100,000 migrants among the EU states is what in fact we need.\" \n\nHe warned if EU \"leaders do not demonstrate goodwill, solidarity will become an empty slogan and will be replaced by political blackmail, divisions and a new blame game.\" \n\nEU leaders promised in June to share 40,000 migrants arriving in Greece and Italy, but the controversial plan is at a standstill amid bickering over how people should be distributed. Many European nations are reluctant to take in more migrants. \n\n---- \n\n1125 GMT \n\nA Greek minister says over 230,000 migrants have arrived in Greece in the first eight months of this year, compared to roughly 17,500 in the same eight months last year. \n\nChristos Zois, the caretaker minister for the merchant marine, said 80 percent of those arriving were refugees. The migrant arrivals in just July and August alone surpassed 157,000, he said. \n\nThe country's caretaker government \u2014 in power until Greece holds an early election on Sept. 20 \u2014 is announcing immediate measures in order to tackle the refugee crisis that has overwhelmed its eastern Aegean islands and northern border with Macedonia. \n\nZois said authorities have received information that there could be millions more refugees waiting to cross toward Europe through Greece. The vast majority of refugees do not want to remain in financially stricken Greece and head north to more prosperous European countries. \n\n--- \n\n1110 GMT \n\nFrench President Francois Hollande is calling an emergency meeting of top government officials to address Europe's migrant crisis. \n\nAmong others, the meeting Thursday afternoon will include Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who earlier in the day had called for urgent solutions for Europe's migrant crisis. \n\nFrench public opinion appeared divided over the summer on whether to take in more migrants, but the government is under increasing pressure to help resolve the Europe-wide issue. \n\nGermany expects to take in over 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, the most in Europe, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged other EU nations to take in more migrants. \n\n---- \n\n1055 GMT \n\nTurkey's state-run news agency says police have detained four suspected human smugglers a day after 12 migrants drowned while trying to reach a Greek island. \n\nThe dead migrants included a 3-year-old boy whose body washed up on a beach, galvanizing a worldwide debate about migration. \n\nThe Anadolu Agency said organized crime police detained the suspects, including at least one Syrian citizen, on a beach on Turkey's Bodrum peninsula. They were sent to a court Thursday to face charges.

The move comes a day after Czech authorities announced they no longer intended to prevent Syrians who had already claimed asylum in Hungary from traveling via its territory to Germany. \n\nThe Czechs previously had detained Syrian migrants, as well as those from other nations, for up to 42 days. The new policy could allow Syrian migrants to travel more freely to Berlin because the most direct Hungarian trains to Germany's capital pass through the Czech Republic. \n\nPolice spokeswoman Katerina Rendlova says the Syrians have seven days to leave the country. \n\n--- \n\n1000 GMT \n\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban says he plans to deploy the military as part of a crackdown on migrants and human traffickers in coming weeks and blames Germany for the influx through his country. \n\nArriving in Brussels for talks about the crisis, Orban said the Hungarian parliament is pushing through new measures \"that will create a new legal situation at the borders, even more strict than it was.\" \n\nAsked by The Associated Press whether the military will be deployed to defend Hungary's borders, he said: \"Yes.\" \n\nOrban said in Brussels that the migrant \"problem is not a European problem, the problem is a German problem, nobody would like to stay in Hungary.\" \n\n--- \n\n0900 GMT \n\nFrench Prime Minister Manuel Valls has tweeted the photo of the dead 3-year-old on the beach, writing: \"He had a name: Aylan Kurdi. Urgent to act. Urgent to have a European mobilization.\" \n\n--- \n\n0850 GMT \n\nCzech police say they have stopped marking the arms of migrants with numbers \u2014 a practice reminiscent of the Holocaust. \n\nPolice on Tuesday marked arms after they detained more than 200 people, mostly Syrians, in Breclav who arrived on trains from Hungary and Austria in Germany-bound trains. \n\nSpokeswoman Katerina Rendlova defended the practice, saying it was used in a chaotic situation to prevent children from being separated from mothers. Rendlova says police initially gave them the numbers on a piece of paper but the migrants threw them away. \n\nRendlova said Thursday police will use wristbands instead. \n\nKlara Holikova from the Association for Integration and Migration commended the change but said the major problem is that migrants are detained at all. \n\n--- \n\n0833 GMT \n\nGreece's coast guard says it has rescued hundreds of migrants or refugees at sea as they attempted to reach Greek islands clandestinely from the nearby Turkish coast. \n\nThe coast guard says it had picked up 751 people in 19 incidents between Wednesday morning and Thursday morning off the coasts of the islands of Lesbos, Samos, Agathonissi, Farmakonissi, Kalymnos and Symi. The figures do not include the hundreds more who reach the islands' shores each day. \n\nWith its massive coastline and proximity of its islands to the Turkish coast, Greece is the main point of entry into the European Union for a stream of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia. \n\n--- \n\n0737 GMT \n\nMigrants poured into Budapest's Keleti rail station on Thursday as police stopped blocking its main entrance, piling into trains despite announcements that there was no service to Western Europe. \n\nHungary's railway company said it had suspended all direct trains from the Hungarian capital to western destinations.

If you do your best and it's not good enough, then it's not good enough. I think what you have to understand is you're accountable.\n\n\"For me, it was results. If we lost I always expected to be held accountable. You need to expect a few smacks in the mouth along the way but you have to get up.\"\n\nAs his successor Steve Smith prepares for his first series as skipper, Clarke - who led Australia to a World Cup victory over New Zealand earlier in the year - said the scrutiny failed to dampen his love for the job.\n\n\"It's an honour and privilege to be captain,\" he said. \"I know people say that when they get the opportunity but don't necessarily feel that at the end of their careers, but I do. I gave it everything I had and my teammates did the same.\"\n\nAs Australia's 43rd Test captain Clarke led Australia on 47 occasions, winning 24 Tests, losing 16 and drawing seven for a winning percentage of 51.06. While he is happy to allow others to \"dictate\" the successes and failings of his career, he is proud his players respected his approach.\n\n\"You need to be open and honest,\" he said. \"My decisions were never personal, they were always based on what was best for the team, and I think my teammates respected that.\n\n\"I never made it personal. I made it about the team and if someone didn't pull their weight and I didn't see it, I had good leadership in our group who'd pick that player up.\n\n\"I think that's really important in the Australian team, you work hard, you put the team first. That culture has stuck for a long time and must continue to stay there. You need good players around you because you can't do everything as captain - you need help and support and I was fortunate to have that.\"\n\nClarke, who admitted he didn't watch Australia play England during the recent one-day series, said he didn't enter the Ashes knowing it would be the last series of a career in which he played 115 Tests and 245 one-day internationals.\n\n\"My goal was to help Australia win [the World Cup and Ashes] and to make a decision after that, but unfortunately it didn't go to plan,\" he said. \"Whether I would've retired or not if we won, who knows? Win or lose, I think the result might have been the same ...\n\n\"Life doesn't feel too different other than I haven't had to pick up a bat. I didn't watch any of the one-day series in England but I'm obviously pleased the boys won that series.\n\n\"Retirement has sunk in. I thought about it long and hard before I made my decision and because I know I've made the right decision it feels fine.\n\n\"I want the boys to go to Bangladesh and enjoy success. There's plenty of talent in that team, it's just going to take them time to play together and build that camaraderie. I know Australian cricket is in good hands, there's always been talent in our domestic system.\"\n\nClarke, who has opened a coaching academy, will mentor and coach 40 young cricketers through a five-day live-in camp at Sydney's Scots College which starts on Sunday, and he vowed it won't be a holiday.\n\n\"It's five days of 6am until 7.30pm,\" he said. \"But it will provide a great insight into what it means \u2013 and takes - to play at the highest level.\" The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.","title":"I gave my all, says retired Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke","media-type":"News","source":"Northwest Tasmania Advocate","published":"2015-09-19T07:54:12Z"}

Kevin Glenn gives us the best opportunity to win this game against Ottawa, so he will start at quarterback,\" said Dyce. \n \nThis decision was really the first major one that Dyce has had to make since being named to his new job a couple of weeks ago. \n \nThere were two prevailing thoughts when it came to Glenn or Smith this week. Should the Riders put their best foot forward to win, or try and develop for the future with the playoffs all but mathematically out of the equation? \n \n\"The playoffs may be out for (the media and fans) but not for us. There's still an opportunity,\" said Dyce. \n \n\"The real reason is this, when we walked into the room a while ago, we said our focus was winning games.\" \n [embedded content] \nGlenn has been out since tearing his pectoral muscle against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on July 26 at Mosaic Stadium. \n \nEven though it's only been a month-and-a-half, for Glenn, it's felt like an eternity since he was able to play. \n \n\"My concern was just to get back healthy. Get back and healthy and when I can give the opportunity or I get an opportunity to help the team, then I'm just going to try and take advantage of it,\" he said. \n \nSmith will now return to the role of backup quarterback, a job he held for a few weeks after Darian Durant went down with a season ending injury in the opening week of the season. \n \nDyce feels that Smith dropping down the depth chart will actually be a good thing for him. \n \n\"Now it gives him an opportunity to see how a very successful professional quarterback operates and manages a game. That's just something Brett hasn't had the opportunity to see.\" \n \nSmith admits that taking a step back is always a little frustrating because as a player, you want to play. Overall though, he understands the decision and will do what he can to help the team. \n \n\"That's the direction that the coaches want to go, I'm going to be the best teammate I can for Kevin,\" he said. \n MESSAM MISSES PRACTICE  \nAnother big story line out of practice on Tuesday was the status of running back Jerome Messam. \n \nDuring Saturday's Banjo Bowl, Messam left the game after taking a pretty serious hit. Messam returned to the game some 10 minutes later. \n \nOn Tuesday, Dyce announced that Messam was going through the concussion protocol. That begs the question, why was he allowed to return the game? \n \n\"Here's the thing, you don't know necessarily with regards to if someone has a concussion. There's a lot of different things that go into diagnosing a concussion. More than I can understand, that's for sure,\" said Dyce. \n \n\"We have 100 per cent faith in our medical staff that they make the right decisions.\" \n NEWS AND NOTES  \nAlso absent from practice on Tuesday were defensive back Terrell Maze and fullback Scott McHenry. \n \nFullback Spencer Moore returned to practice as he's eligible to return from the six-game injured list, as did receiver Seydou Junior Hadaira. \n \nThe Riders announced on Tuesday the release of defensive back Mark LeGree and quarterback Blake Sims. \n \nLinebacker Denicos Allen, defensive back Kip Edwards and defensive lineman David Hunter were also added to the team's practice roster.","title":"Kevin Glenn gets the call for Riders against Redblacks","media-type":"News","source":"News Talk 650 CKOM","published":"2015-09-15T21:27:18Z"}

The Angels used their fourth consecutive victory to remain half a game behind the Houston Astros, who hold the American League's second wild-card spot, and move within four games of the first-place Texas Rangers in the AL West.But Los Angeles might have lost closer Huston Street, who leads the AL with 40 saves. Street left the game in the top of the ninth after running to cover third base on a ground ball. As Street was running, he pulled up and was unable to put any weight on his left leg.Street, who faced only two batters and allowed one hit in one-third of an inning, is the second reliever to suffer an injury within the week. The Angels lost right-hander Joe Smith, their eighth-inning specialist, when he sprained his left ankle while walking down a hotel stairway Sept. 19.Freese, the first batter in the bottom of the ninth, powered an 89 mph fastball from right-hander Danny Farquhar (1-5) over the outstretched glove of center fielder Shawn O'Malley and the outfield fence for his 12th homer of the season.Right-hander Fernando Salas (4-2) picked up the victory in relief.The Mariners put the potential winning run at third base in the top of the ninth. Second baseman Robinson Cano began the inning by lining a single to right field. Pinch-runner Brad Miller replaced Cano, stole second base and moved to third when center fielder James Jones grounded out, the play on which Street suffered his injury.Left-hander Jose Alvarez replaced Street and induced pinch-hitter Seth Smith to hit a sharp ground ball that first baseman C.J. Cron dived to field. Miller moved to third when Cron threw to Alvarez for the out at first. Salas then relieved Alvarez and made catcher Jesus Sucre ground out to end the inning.The Angels loaded the bases twice in the bottom of the first inning against right-hander Felix Hernandez, the Mariners' 18-game winner, but had to settle for a 1-0 lead.Right fielder Kole Calhoun singled with one out and took second base on center fielder Mike Trout's infield single. After designated hitter Albert Pujols walked to load the bases, Calhoun scored on left fielder David Murphy's sacrifice fly. Los Angeles reloaded the bases when Cron reached on catcher's interference, but Hernandez defused the threat by striking out Freese.Seattle tied the score in the top of the second. Left fielder Franklin Gutierrez walked to begin the inning, moved to third on first baseman Jesus Montero's one-out double and scored when Sucre grounded out. In the bottom of the second, the Angels had a chance to re-take the lead but squandered more opportunities.Second baseman Johnny Giavotella tripled to right-center field with one out but when shortstop Erick Aybar tried to squeeze Giavotella home, Hernandez fielded the ball and used his glove to shovel to ball to Sucre for the tag. Then with the bases again loaded, Pujols ended the inning by grounding out. Mariners shortstop Ketel Marte made the Angels pay in the top of the third when he hit his first major-league home run. On a 1-1 count, Marte propelled Andrew Heaney's 83 mph changeup into the Angels' left-field bullpen to put Seattle ahead 2-1.Trout stole a second home run in the top of the fourth. When Montero pounded a deep fly ball to center field, Trout jumped, grabbed the top of the fence with his right hand, steadied himself and made a backhanded catch about three feet from the top of the fence in front of the 396-foot sign.After he threw the ball to the infield, Trout swung his right arm, pumped a fist and yelled \"Let's go!\" The fans responded by chanting \"M-V-P, M-V-P.\"Cron tied the score in the sixth with his 16th home run of the season. He hit Hernandez's 92 mph fastball off the top of the Cypress trees behind the center-field fence.NOTES: Seattle 3B Kyle Seager played his 627th game since 2012 on Saturday night, the most of any major leaguer at any position. ... Mariners DH Nelson Cruz gave his team 106 home runs on the road when he hit his 43rd of the season Friday night, the most for the club since 2000. Seattle leads the majors in road homers. ... Josh Byrnes, former general manager for the Arizona Diamondbacks and the San Diego Padres, has emerged as a candidate for the Angels' vacant GM position. Byrnes currently works as the Los Angeles Dodgers' vice president of baseball operations. ... Angels 3B David Freese became the first player at his position to amass 10 doubles in a month for the club since Troy Glaus accomplished the feat in May 2001.

We also benefit because this is often how we find our gems for Gentle Family Dentistry.\" \n\nThe students under Dr. Locker\u2019s supervision undergo a standard clinical rotation that covers all phases of general dentistry. Dental assistants at Gentle Family Dentistry work with Dr. Locker to provide quality and compassionate dentistry to every patient. \"The training is time consuming but a worthwhile adventure as we invest in growth and the future of the dental industry,\" Dr. Locker said. \n\nGentle Family Dentistry is a modern, five-operatory practice with state-of-the-art equipment. The practice, 510 Third Ave., offers cleanings, smile makeovers, crowns and bridges, dentures and partial dentures, deep bleaching, snoring and sleep apnea appliances, composite white fillings, root canal therapy, extractions and gum disease treatment.

The office offers digital X-rays, which reduce radiation by up to 90 percent, and The Wand for painless Novocain delivery every time. Dr. Locker introduced The Wand to help ease patients\u2019 fears of the dentist. Now his patients can expect pain-free Novocain delivery while they undergo restorative or cosmetic procedures. \n\nDr. Locker takes a special interest in nutrition and naturalistic health maintenance, and he works to educate patients on how their oral health affects their overall health. Dr. Locker writes and manages a blog on his website that provides dental health tips and discusses new studies and trends in dentistry. \n\nDr. Locker is a U.S. Army veteran who served in Vietnam. He grew up in Passaic, N.J., and attended Rutgers University for his undergraduate studies and then New Jersey Dental School (now Rutgers School of Dental Medicine).

He voluntarily stepped down as chairman and remains a faculty member. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen born in China.\n\nThe dismissal motion comes after Xi and his lawyer, Peter Zeidenberg, gave a presentation on Aug. 21 to investigators. That presentation included affidavits from world-renowned physicists and experts who looked at the emails between Xi and contacts in China and explained that he was involved in a scientific pursuit that had a very narrow commercial application and did not involve restricted technology, Zeidenberg said.\n\n\"We're very relieved that the charges against my father were dropped,\" his daughter, Joyce Xi, said by telephone from the family's home in the Philadelphia suburbs. \"It's been a very difficult time for our family and we're looking forward to regaining some normalcy in our lives.\"\n\nThe motion still must be approved by U.S. District Judge R. Barclay Surrick.\n\nFederal prosecutors want the opportunity to confer with their own outside experts and have reserved the right to bring charges again, Zeidenberg said.\n\n\"We have no reason to think that that's going to happen,\" he said.\n\nAsked how the government made such a mistake, Zeidenberg said he didn't know.\n\nProsecutors thought he was sending information related to a magnesium diboride pocket heater for which he had signed a nondisclosure agreement, Zeidenberg said.\n\nWhen they arrested Xi in May, prosecutors said he had participated in a Chinese government program involving technology innovation before he took a sabbatical in 2002 to work with a U.S. company that developed a thin-film superconducting device containing magnesium diboride.\n\nSuperconductivity is the ability to conduct electricity without resistance. A superconducting thin film could be key to making computer circuits that work faster. Films of magnesium diboride are particularly promising for this use, and Xi helped develop a way to make them.\n\nProsecutors say he \"exploited it for the benefit of third parties in China, including government entities,\" by sharing it with the help of his post-doctoral students from China. Xi also offered to build a world-class thin film laboratory there, according to emails detailed by prosecutors in May.\n\nBut Xi was sending information about a different device, which he helped invent. It was not restricted technology or supposed to be kept secret by a nondisclosure agreement, Zeidenberg said.\n\n\"It was typical academic collaboration,\" Zeidenberg said. \"Nobody's getting rich off this stuff.\"\n\nIn any case, the pocket heater is patented and plans on how to make it can be looked up online, Zeidenberg said.\n\n___\n\nLevy and Jackson reported from Harrisburg, Pa.","title":"US dropping sale-of-secrets-to-China case against professor","media-type":"News","source":"Estherville Daily News","published":"2015-09-12T03:45:30Z"}

Football Manager Mobile will also be coming to all iOS and Android devices. \n \n\u201cFor some time now it\u2019s been clear to us that there is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 football management experience,\u201d says Sports Interactive head Miles Jacobson. \"The introduction of Football Manager Touch as a standalone offering \u2013 playable across computer and tablet \u2013 means that we now offer something for everyone.\u201d \n \nAs for new features, FM2016 now includes a create-a-club mode, and a fantasy draft mode where you compete with other managers to build a squad from scratch with a fixed budget, followed by a mini-league. Other tweaks and additions include more manager customization options, a set piece creator, more realistic injuries, extended press interaction, and improved AI transfers. \n \nFM Touch will also have the create-a-club mode, and it will have cross-save, so a career saved to the cloud can be accessed on your tablet or your PC. \n \nPre-ordering FM2016 from participating retailers will also grant you a key for An Alternative Reality: the Football Manager Documentary. Additionally, you'll gain access to the full beta two weeks before the game launches. \n \nThe full Football Manager 2016 is scheduled for release on November 13, with Football Manager Touch and Mobile available \"before Christmas.\" \n \nIn IGN's review of last year's Football Manager 2015 , we said that \"better menu layouts, countless new options and improved match-day features see FM2015 remain in title-winning form.\" \n \nMatt Porter is a freelance writer based in London.

{"id":"e4ed4ec6-f9c3-4058-bc1f-9f32775090a7","content":"Scientists at the University of Twente in the Netherlands have devised a new type of electronic chip that takes after the human brain. Their device is highly power-conscious, massively parallel, and can manipulate data in arbitrary ways \u2013 even though it doesn't need to be explicitely designed to perform any task. The advance could pave the way for computers that think more like we do. \n (When the) chips are down  \nElectronic chips as they are currently designed come with plenty of drawbacks. Even the simplest operations, like adding or subtracting, need large numbers of transistors arranged in a very specific, well thought-out pattern. These transistors quickly add up and drain power even when idle (unless specific measures are taken). Moreover, most circuits can't effectively process information in parallel, leading to a further waste of time and energy. \n \nAll of these factors make it especially hard for today's computers to perform many crucial tasks quickly and on little power \u2013 particularly the kinds of tasks that the human brain can tackle with ease, like recognizing a visual pattern or understanding human language. In fact, when it comes to simulating brain-like functionality, many researchers have opted to abandon traditional computer architectures altogether. \n \nAlternative chip designs that try to mimic the prowess and efficiency of the brain usually do so by either resorting to massive parallelism or by using neuron-like structures as their basic building blocks. But these approaches retain one big drawback: they still rely on fallible human minds to design their hardware and software. \n No design needed  \nA research team led by professors Wilfried van der Wiel and Hajo Broersma is walking a different path. Remarkably, their device takes people out of the the circuit design equation altogether and leaves it to the chip itself to figure out how to best manipulate its inputs into the desired output through artificial evolution. \n \nTheir proof-of-principle device consists of a network of up to 100 densely interconnected gold nanoparticles, 20 nanometers in size, each acting as a tiny transistor . The researchers call it a natural computer , because the way in which the particles are interlinked is reminiscent of neural networks in the brain. Unlike in a standard circuit, the scientists themselves don't exactly know how the transistors in a natural computer connect with each other \u2013 but this doesn't stop the circuit from working as intended. \n \nHere's, in a nutshell, how it all works. The nanoparticle cluster can be thought of as a black box containing two input signals, one output signal, and six control voltages that are fed to the edge of the cluster and affect how the network elaborates its inputs. Rather than designing the entire circuit by hand, the researchers can simply look for the exact combination of control voltages that process all the inputs into the correct outputs. \n    \n\"Although we understand the generic physics principles underlying the cluster\u2019s behavior, we do not know the actual current paths in the network on a nanoscale level,\" van der Weil told Gizmag. \n \nUsing \"designless\" systems such as this means that costly design mistakes are avoided, and in fact this approach can work around, or even take advantage of, material defects like crosstalk that must be avoided at all costs in conventional electronics. \n \nEven better, if the chip were to sustain heavy damage, it could still be reconfigured just as easily by adjusting the voltage values for the signals that control how the nanoparticle cluster manipulates the data. \n Natural selection and \"baby voltages\"  \nSelection of the optimal values for the six control voltages is not done manually or even by brute force, but instead by using something called a genetic algorithm (GA). In computer science, this is a clever (and well-known) way to optimize a set of parameters for an arbitrary condition. Just like the idea behind the circuit itself, GAs also take shameless inspiration from nature. \n \nThe basic idea behind GAs is to create successive \"generations\" of values by \"marrying\" them to each other (by combining them and adding an element of randomness), and then seeing which of the \"offspring\" is the best fit. This is in obvious analogy to the way in which natural selection picks, through successive generations, the optimal gene pool that is best adapted to live in the surrounding environment. \n \nThough this process is more complicated than mere bruteforcing, it's also much faster. In this case, the researchers say the process takes less than an hour (as opposed to several days) to find all of the six voltage parameters for a set condition. \n \nOptimizing the voltages for different functionalities, the researchers were able to indirectly \"program\" the chip to act as any one of the Boolean logic gates . This was done using a number of nanoparticles comparable to the number of transistors that would be needed to implement the same function on a standard chip. \n Toward brain-like computing  \nAccording to the researchers, this structure has great potential for saving energy compared to a standard chip: \n \n\"Natural computers have, in general, the promise to be more energy efficient,\" van der Weil told Gizmag. \"The promise for lower energy consumption is based on the fact that natural computers take more advantage of the computational power of matter than conventional computers, and that many computational processes occur in parallel as opposed to sequentially as in conventional computers.\" \n \nThe researchers also believe their device holds real promise with respect to complex tasks involving pattern recognition that the human brain excels at: \n \n\"In our device many operations can occur in parallel, analogous to information processing in the brain,\" van der Weil continued. \"We know that the brain, but also mathematical neural networks, are very suitable for pattern recognition. We believe that our system can be a physical realization of a cellular neural network with the accompanying advantages compared to conventional circuits.\" \n \nTheir invention doesn't come without drawbacks, however. One being that the system can currently only operate at temperatures close to absolute zero \u2013 though the scientists tell us this can be easily fixed. \n \n\"Our approach only works if the nanoparticles act as single-electron transistors and relies on Coulomb blockade ,\" says van der Wiel. \"For 20 nm nanoparticles this means that we have to be at temperatures lower than 5 Kelvin (-268\u00b0 C, - 451\u00b0 F) or so. However, there is no fundamental reason why our approach should not work at room temperature. This would require smaller nanoparticles.\" \n \nA more complex circuit may need to use clusters of 100 nanoparticles as its elementary block, since optimizing larger nanoparticle networks through signals that only reach its periphery could be difficult. \n \n\"We either need to go to interconnecting smaller networks, or to more advanced electrode configurations. This is work in progress,\" says van der Weil. \n \nThe next steps for the team's research will be to \"create larger networks with more complex functionality, preferably at room temperature.\" \n \nThe findings have been published on the journal Nature Nanoelectronics . \n\n \nSource: University of Twente","title":"\"Designless\" brain-like chips created through artificial evolution","media-type":"News","source":"Gizmag","published":"2015-09-29T01:39:41Z"}
{"id":"4bc67bc3-e841-4f60-8bd6-b61bb38cb3cb","content":"HALIFAX, N.S.  \u2014 One would think it would be an oxymoron to use the words \u201ceconomical\u201d and \u201cpickup truck\u201d in the same sentence.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            But don\u2019t tell the folks at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), who are touting their Ram 1500 EcoDiesel as the antithesis of the traditional gas-guzzling pickup.   \r \n\r \n\r\n                            To demonstrate this fact, FCA Canada took us down to the Maritimes to drive a sampling of 2015 Ram EcoDiesel models and discover just how fuel-efficient they can be.   \r \n\r \n\r\n                            After all, Natural Resources Canada fuel consumption ratings are one thing and real-world driving is another.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            The exercise was for four teams of two drivers to spend a half-day each in one of four Ram EcoDiesel vehicles, all with different trim levels. At the end of the two days the fuel economy numbers for all the vehicles would be tabulated to see how we fared.   \r \n\r \n\r\n                            The drive route started in Fredericton, N.B. early on a Wednesday morning, eventually heading to the picturesque Bay of Fundy area and then to the Confederation Bridge, which links New Brunswick to Prince Edward Island.   \r \n\r \n\r\n                            After an evening in Charlottetown, PEI, we headed to the Wood Islands ferry that would take us to Nova Scotia with our end point being the beautiful city of Halifax.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            It was a wonderful drive with awesome scenery, wonderful vistas, friendly locals and some challenging roads.   \r \n\r \n\r\n                            There was quite a mixture of driving routes, but as much as possible we hugged the coastline to see the breathtaking scenery.   \r \n\r \n\r\n                            It was a nice test that demonstrates you don\u2019t have to have a sedan, SUV or sports car to enjoy a driving holiday in this great country of ours. A fuel-efficient pickup like the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel will do quite nicely, thank you.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            At the end of the day, the numbers tell the story. We visited three provinces, drove between 747.5 to 839.9 kilometres on a single tank of fuel and the fuel consumption numbers ranged from 8.6L\/100 km to 9.3L\/100 km, averaging 8.85.   \r \n\r \n\r\n                            That\u2019s almost dead on the 8.8L\/100 km EnerGuide highway number from the Government of Canada and our driving was a combination of both highway and city driving.   \r \n\r \n\r\n                            Pretty impressive numbers when you consider the size and the weight of these pickups that have a lot to offer the consumer who needs a truck for hauling or towing. And even if it\u2019s just occasionally that you really need the utility of a pickup, with this EcoDiesel you\u2019re not being penalized in the pocketbook.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            Even after two days of driving through three provinces, we still had plenty of fuel left in the tanks, enough at least for another half day on the road and more than 1,200 kilometres in total on a tank of diesel fuel.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            And for those unfamiliar with new breed of diesel, these aren\u2019t the smoke belching, clattering engines of old. They are clean, quiet and smoke free.   \r \n\r \n\r\n                            The Ram 1500 is the only full-size, light-duty pickup on the market to offer a diesel powertrain. And it has been a popular option with customers as about one in four Ram 1500s sold in Canada this year is an EcoDiesel. As you move up the trim line, as many as 50 per cent of the high-end Laramie, Longhorn and Limited models have been diesel.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            One wonders why other manufacturers haven\u2019t gone this route, but FCA executives will be happy to have this market all to themselves. It has made Ram the second best-selling vehicle in the country and FCA\u2019s top-selling model. At the end of August, Ram sales numbers sit at 62,487, a jump of seven per cent over 2014.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            While you save at the fuel pumps, the Ram EcoDiesel is not inexpensive. Prices start at $39,295 (the EcoDiesel engine itself has an MSRP of $4,700) and the engine is available on all regular, quad or crew cabs.   \r \n\r \n\r\n                            The 3.0-litre turbocharged V6 EcoDiesel is paired with an eight-speed transmission and makes 240 hp and a class-leading 420 lb\/ft of low-end torque. If you have to haul a boat or trailer, it has an impressive tow rating of 4,713 kg (9,200 lb).  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            The engine itself is built by VM Motori, an Italian manufacturer that has been a Chrysler supplier since 1992. The company was purchased outright by Fiat in 2013.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            One model we tested is the high-end Laramie Limited in 4x4 Crew Cab format. It\u2019s pricey, $71,760 as tested, but comes with all the bells and whistles like leather upholstery, dual zone climate control, chrome bumpers, heated first and second-row seats and ventilated front row seats. Four-wheel-drive is available on all trim levels and one feature that many buyers might find desirable is the optional four-corner air suspension ($1,695). With this system, the truck can be raised if you need more clearance and lowered for ease of entry and exit. At speed, the truck is automatically lowered for better aerodynamics and load leveling is also automatic.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            Other models we tested included the, Big Horn 4x4 Crew Cab, Outdoorsman Quad Cab 4x4 and a Ram 1500 SLT Crew Cab 4x4. There are a multitude of variations, so visit www.ramtruck.ca for all the details.  \r \n\r \n\r\n                            The Ram 1500 is a popular choice among pickup buyers with any powertrain, but if fuel economy is your prime consideration then the 1500 EcoDiesel is the vehicle for you.  \r \n\r \n\r RAM 1500 ECODIESEL 2015 AT A GLANCE \r \n\r \n\r BODY STYLE: Full-size, half-ton light-duty pickup truck  \r \n\r \n\r DRIVE METHOD: Four-wheel-drive; eight-speed automatic transmission  \r \n\r \n\r ENGINE: Turbocharged 3.0-litre V6 EcoDiesel (240 hp, 420 lb\/ft of torque at 2,000 rpm)  \r \n\r \n\r TOW RATING : 4,713 kg (9,200 lb)  \r \n\r \n\r FUEL ECONOMY : 12.1L\/100 km city, 8.8L\/100 km hwy.  \r \n\r \n\r PRICE: $39,295 to $56,135  \r \n\r \n\r WEB SITE:  www.ramtruck.ca \r \n\r \n\r WHAT\u2019S BEST: The fuel economy of the EcoDiesel of course.  \r \n\r \n\r WHAT\u2019S WORST: There\u2019s a $4,700 premium for the diesel engine and $1,000 for the eight-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission on certain models.  \r \n\r \n\r WHAT\u2019S INTERESTING: Ram 1500 is the only full-size light duty pickup to offer a diesel powertrain.","title":"Ram 1500 EcoDiesel 2015 focuses on economy","media-type":"News","source":"DurhamRegion.com","published":"2015-09-20T17:00:00Z"}

World War II officially ended on\u00a0Sept. 2, 1945, although Russia celebrates its Victory Day on\u00a0May 9, to\u00a0mark the\u00a0end of\u00a0the war in\u00a0Europe. \n \nThe\u00a0images show prisoners playing musical instruments and\u00a0board games, eating at\u00a0a mess hall and\u00a0posing for\u00a0a group photo. \n \nHistorian Andrei Samokhin said that prisoners of\u00a0war enjoyed better living conditions than even Russian civilians, even though the\u00a0work was hard, and\u00a0the food was unfamiliar to\u00a0the Asian palate, Dozhd reported. \n \n\"The Japanese prisoners ate the\u00a0same way as the\u00a0soldiers of\u00a0the Red Army; their living conditions were based on\u00a0the same standards,\" Samokhin was quoted as saying. \"Soviet civilians\u00a0\u2014 for\u00a0instance, those who worked at\u00a0factories \u2014 received smaller rations.\" \n \nVadim Karaman, another historian, concurred that \"prisoners generally received better treatment than [the Soviet Union's] own citizens\" \u2014 a\u00a0practice he said might be attributed to\u00a0the supposed plotting by\u00a0the Soviet government to\u00a0establish a\u00a0\"Japanese Socialist Republic, along the\u00a0lines of\u00a0North Korea,\" Dozhd reported. \n \nJapanese prisoners were offered classes in\u00a0the Russian language as well as studies in\u00a0Marxism and\u00a0the works of\u00a0Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, Samokhin said, Dozhd reported. \n \n\"Despite the\u00a0fact that there was a\u00a0directive that banned forceful conversion to\u00a0communism, ideological work was going on\u00a0at the\u00a0camps,\" he added. \"The prisoners included those who were truly charmed by\u00a0communism: They saw how a\u00a0former peasant could become a\u00a0military officer, which was impossible in\u00a0Japan.\" \n \nBut Japanese soldier Miyamoto Tsutomu, who spent 1945-1949 in\u00a0a POW camp in\u00a0Russia's Far East, painted a\u00a0different picture in\u00a0his memoirs, according to\u00a0the report. \n \n\"I recall an\u00a0old ensign, sitting motionlessly by\u00a0the fire and\u00a0saying: 'Since they don't feed us even rice, may one go collect more firewood?'\" Tsutomu was quoted as saying. \"Or the\u00a0former middle school teacher who stole bits of\u00a0salmon during the\u00a0night from\u00a0a kitchen cauldron.

{"id":"e5e8111e-0afb-4e5a-9374-921a4fc892d3","content":"The following recap was provided by the Pittsburgh Riverhounds \n \nPITTSBURGH (Sept. 16, 2015) \u2013 The Pittsburgh Riverhounds tied the United Soccer League regular season champion Rochester Rhinos 1-1 Wednesday night at Highmark Stadium to set up a pulsating finale to the Eastern Conference this Saturday night in Harrisburg. \n \nThe result allied with victories for the Harrisburg City Islanders and Richmond Kickers Wednesday leaves the Hounds needing to win in Pennsylvania\u2019s state capital to clinch a spot in the USL playoffs. A tie or a loss will end the Hounds\u2019 season. \n \nLebo Moloto broke the deadlock after 69 minutes of a typically cagey affair against the Rhinos with a brilliant curling shot from 30 yards. Christian Volesky leveled for the visitors with seven minutes remaining. \n \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play well in the first half and we played into their style,\u201d said Hounds head coach Mark Steffens. \u201cI thought we did well defensively and had the better of the play in the second half. \n \n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the guys.\u201d \n \nThe Hounds (10-9-8, 38 points) lie in eighth place going into the final weekend. Harrisburg (11-10-6, 39 points) sits one point and one place ahead after thumping F.C. Montreal 5-0 earlier in the evening. Three points Saturday will pull Pittsburgh level with the fifth-placed Richmond Kickers (10-7-11, 41 points). Steffens\u2019 men hold the head-to-head advantage over the Virginians. \n \nA scoreless first half was played to the tempo that the Rhinos preferred. Rochester\u2019s towering fullback Onua Obasi proved prolific in winning his challenges and creating potentially dangerous turnovers in the midfield. \n \nRochester forward Steevan Dos Santos came closest to finding the net in the opening period with a low shot on 34 minutes that Hounds\u2019 goalkeeper Calle Brown tipped onto his right post. \n \nMax Touloute looked lively early in the game after receiving his first start since Aug. 22. The Haitian forward dribbled through multiple opponents on 17 minutes before going down under a fair challenge in the penalty area. Kevin Kerr released Touloute into space on the right side on 29 minutes. Rochester\u2019s stuffy defense closed him out before he could get his cross over toward the lurking Vini Dantas. \n \nMoloto netted his fifth goal of his first year in Pittsburgh with a stunning finish that left Rhinos goalkeeper Adam Grinwis helpless. The South African playmaker spun toward Rochester\u2019s goal after receiving a pass from Rob Vincent before creating space via a sharp one-two with substitute Miro Cabrilo. Moloto arched a spectacular shot high above Grinwis\u2019 reach and into the goalkeeper\u2019s top left corner. \n \nGrinwis was much more active in the second half. Cabrilo hit a wicked shot on 81 minutes that looked to be slicing towards the far post until the Michigan Bucks product touched it wide. \n \nHolding onto late leads has been the Hounds\u2019 Achilles heel this season. They were outdone again by a rapid Rhinos sequence when substitutes Colin Rolfe and Nate Bordeau combined to send Volesky clear on Brown\u2019s goal. The 23-year-old forward clipped a neat finish over the sprawling goalkeeper. \n \nVincent almost won it for the Hounds on a 20-yard free kick two minutes later. The Steel Army\u2019s Player of the Year unleashed a ferocious drive that drew an exceptional diving save out of Grinwis. \n \nThe Hounds travel to Harrisburg also holding the edge in the Keystone Derby series by virtue of two wins to the Islanders\u2019 one. Kevin Kerr\u2019s hat trick fired the Hounds to a 5-2 victory at Highmark Stadium to open the season back on March 28. Kerr then supplied the dramatic late winner on May 30 when Pittsburgh recovered from a 5-3 deficit in the final minute to record an incredible 6-5 win. \n \nHarrisburg pulled off its own breathtaking comeback at the Skyline Sports Complex on July 26 to recover from 3-1 down with 10 men to win 4-3 in stoppage time. \n \nA tie will be enough for the Riverhounds to lift the inaugural Keystone Derby Cup. Harrisburg must win by at least a 3-goal margin to keep the trophy in the Pennsylvania state capital during the offseason. \n \nScoring Summary: \nPGH \u2013 Lebo Moloto 69\u2032 (Miro Cabrilo, Rob Vincent) \nROC \u2013 Christian Volesky 83\u2032 (Nate Bordeau, Colin Rolfe) \n \nMisconduct Summary: \nPGH \u2013 Willie Hunt 50\u2032 (caution) \n \nLine-ups: \nRiverhounds \u2013 Calle Brown, Mike Green, Anthony Arena, Willie Hunt, Matt Dallman, Danny Earls, Rob Vincent, Lebo Moloto, Kevin Kerr, Max Touloute (Tyler Pasher 61\u2032), Vini Dantas (Miro Cabrilo 62\u2032) \n \nRochester Rhinos \u2013 Adam Grinwis, Onua Obasi, Vasileios Apostolopoulos, Sean Totsch (Nate Bordeau 77\u2032), Tony Walls, Mike Garza, Marcos Ugarte (Timi Mulgrew 73\u2032), Alex Dixon, Jonny Mendoza (Kenardo Forbes 64\u2032), Steevan Dos Santos (Colin Rolfe 73\u2032), Christian Volesky (Grant Van De Casteele 88\u2032) \n \nOfficials: \nGuido Gonzales Jr. (referee), Lucas Feathers, Justin Frear (assistants), Nathaniel Buck (fourth official) \n \nAttendance: 1,536","title":"Hounds Tie Sets Up Win-And-In Finale In Harrisburg","media-type":"News","source":"KDKA","published":"2015-09-17T03:34:23Z"}

A second round of flight tests was recently completed to ensure readiness for operational use by partner airlines. \n \n\"We are excited to partner with NASA to test this new technology that has the potential to help reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions and save our guests time in the air,\" commented Steve Forte, Virgin America's chief operating officer in Burlingame, California. \n \nDevelopers say the new technology will not require changes to the roles and responsibilities of pilots or air traffic controllers.","title":"NASA technology to help airlines save fuel, time","media-type":"News","source":"ProKerala.com","published":"2015-09-23T06:51:01Z"}

That is the spirit I love. The players believed in something good as a group and that is what I want. \n \n\"You can lose, of course, but it is important to fight until the end of the match. This victory is important to restart well after the break and to get three points is fantastic.\" \n \nLabelled 'the Tinkerman' from his previous spell in England with Chelsea a decade ago, Ranieri's return has actually been notable for his lack of changes. \n \nSunday was the first time he had swapped more than one player from the previous starting line-up, as Gokhan Inler was handed his full Barclays Premier League debut in place of Andy King and Shinji Okazaki replaced Ngolo Kante. \n \nBut it was his changes during the game that helped swing things back Leicester's way, introducing Dyer at half-time and moving Riyad Mahrez into a more central role before bringing on Leonardo Ulloa and Kante immediately after Villa went 2-0 ahead. \n   Promoted stories   \nThe 63-year-old received a lot of credit for the changes he made but he was quick to deflect the praise back on to his players. \n \n\"I saw that the team wanted something different, to keep the spirit going,\" he said. \n \n\"It gave motivation to the team and it was good. I told the players they were keeping the ball better than us but if we played together we could do something good, and the players did it - they did it all. \n \n\"I have a lot of experience but I said to the players that this group is fantastic and we must play this way every match because we are in this way.\" \n \nAll those months spent last season towards the foot of the table now seem like a distant memory with Leicester up to second after this victory. \n \nHowever, once again maintaining the club's top-flight status remains the aim for Ranieri. \n \n\"I talk to the players and say we have 11 points - we need another 29,\" he added. \n \n\"I don't know when we will achieve this, which month, but the sooner the better it is possible. This is our goal only at the moment. \n \n\"I don't think about what we can do, I just want the best.\" \n \nDyer's brave late header completed the fightback. The winger remained on the floor for a couple of minutes after clattering into goalkeeper Brad Guzan when heading the 89th-minute clincher, but eventually got to his feet to take the acclaim. \n \nAnd Ranieri reserved some special praise for his latest signing. \n \nHe said: \"It was very brave but every time he received the ball it was good for the team.\" \n \nFor just over and hour it was probably Villa's best performance of the season but they remain  without a league win since the opening day of the season and manager Tim Sherwood could not hide his dejection. \n \n\"I've never felt this bad, ever. Who cares? Who cares if we played well?\" he said. \n \n\"I'm bitterly disappointed for everyone associated with the club because the game is won with around 30 minutes to go. \n \n\"The game was done, it was finished with us 2-0 up. At this level the game should be dead and buried but unfortunately we've made some unforced errors and it has cost us the game. \n \n\"Individual errors. It has been happening a bit this season but it needs to stop happening. \n   \n Share article  \n   \n\"Those goals for Leicester, they haven't had to work very hard for them. \n \n\"The first goal gives them the momentum and unfortunately we couldn't wrestle it back off them. The only way you can do that is by keeping the ball off them and we just kept giving it back to them.

The Impact (9-11-6) responded with a victory at home over Chicago and followed with impressive draws of 0-0 in Los Angeles and 1-1 at San Jose.\n\nThe tie in San Jose looked unlikely when, playing without Drogba, Ignacio Piatti and other top players, they fell behind in the first half and then saw fullback Ambroise Oyongo sent off four minutes after the intermission.\n\nRarely used Kyle Bekker scored in the 65th minute to steal a much-needed point on the road.\n\n\"It's even more encouraging that we earned this point having gone into the half down a goal,\" defender Hassoun Camara, who returned from an injury, said on the Impact website. \"We want to continue this run of form and play well over our next few games to earn a playoff spot.\"\n\nDrogba and a handful of players were sent home after the Los Angeles game to rest up for the meeting with New England, the first of three straight home games that will do much to determine if the sixth-place Impact make the playoffs. After that stretch, they are on the road for four in a row.\n\n\"We had guys who hadn't played together in a while and to go down a goal and then down a man, yet come back and tie (the) game was a tremendous result,\" said Biello. \"I believe in this team and all the players that I have.\"\n\nCentral defender Laurent Ciman will return from a two-game suspension, so most of the team's first 11 will be together, although Oyongo is suspended.\n\nA party atmosphere took over Saputo Stadium for Montreal's last home game, a 4-3 win in which Drogba scored three times in his first MLS start. \n\nThe Revolution can clinch a playoff spot for a third straight year with a victory in Montreal.\n\nMidfielder Jermaine Jones will return from a suspension but defender London Woodberry will sit out a game for yellow card accumulation.","title":"Ciman back as Drogba, Impact get set to face first-place Revolution","media-type":"News","source":"Brandon Sun","published":"2015-09-18T19:31:08Z"}

You and K Rudd have so much in common,\" he wrote. \n\nMr Kennett later told media Mr Turnbull was opportunistic and had committed an act of \"gross disloyal extreme egotism\". \n\nHe labelled him \"without a doubt, the Kevin Rudd of the Liberal Party\". \n\n\"We must be the laughing stock to the world\u2026 to John Key in New Zealand to David Cameron in the United Kingdom\u2026,\" he said. \n\nMr Abetz said the public expected team work and team work. \n\nHe said good leaders had clear values, policy consistency and integrity. \n\n\"The flood of messages \u2026.

Nothing's changed. \n\n\"Australia needs a change of government and Labor will be up for the fight no matter who the Liberal party selects.\" \n\nTurnbull challenges Abbott: 'we need advocacy not slogans' \n\nCOMMUNICATIONS Minister Malcolm Turnbull has resigned from Cabinet and met with the Prime Minister this afternoon to request a ballot for the party leadership. \n\nJulie Bishop has also met with the Prime Minister today on the same issue. \n\nSpeaking to the media this afternoon, Mr Turnbull said he has made his decision based on the urging of \"many people over a long period of time.\" \n\n\"Now this is not a decision that anyone could take lightly. I have consulted with many, many colleagues, many Australians, many of our supporters in every walk of life,\" he said \n\n\" It is clear enough that the Government is not successful in providing the economic leadership that we need. It is not the fault of individual ministers. \n\n\"Ultimately, the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs. He has not been capable of providing the economic confidence that business needs. \n\n\"Now we are living as Australians in the most exciting time. The big economic changes that we're living through here and around the world offer enormous challenges and enormous opportunities. \n\n\"We need a different style of leadership. We need a style of leadership that explains those challenges and opportunities, explains the challenges and how to seize the opportunities. A style of leadership that respects the people's intelligence, that explains these complex issues and then sets out the course of action we believe we should take and makes a case for it. We need advocacy, not slogans. \n\n\"We need to respect the intelligence of the Australian people.\" \n\nMr Turnbull said if Tony Abbott led the party into the next election, Labor would be sure to win. \n\n\"We have lost 30 Newspolls in a row. It is clear that the people have made up their mind about Mr Abbott's leadership.\" \n\nA spill ballot will be held tomorrow. \n\nMr Abbott survived a leadership challenge in February by 61 votes to 39. \n\nEARLIER: Knives out for Abbott: \"This time they will get him\" \n\nPRIME Minister Tony Abbott will face a leadership spill before the year is out, according to news reports today, with senior Ministers claiming this time \"they will get him''. \n\nThe ABC reported it had spoken to eight ministers and six believe Mr Abbott will be challenged no matter what happens at the Canning by-election in Western Australia next Saturday. \n\n\"And this time I think they will get him,\" one minister said. \n\nA double-digit swing against the Liberal Party in Canning would fuel the unrest. \n\nBoth the News Limited Galaxy poll and the Fairfax Ipsos poll point to a 10-point swing. \n\nThe Ipsos poll has the Liberal Party leading Labor after preferences are distributed by 52 to 48 per cent - it was 62 to 38 per cent at the 2013 general election. \n\n\"And that's after we spent $1 million on that seat to save the Prime Minister, and Labor has spent nothing,\" one Cabinet minister said. \n\n\"He said: 'Give me six months.' Well, he has had six months and things have gone from bad to worse. \n\n\"He should just resign.\" \n\nFairfax reported a savage swing in friendly LNP territory in WA would be a 'political death threat to the Abbott government''. \n\nThe Abbott government has now been in a losing position in the national polls for 18 consecutive months. \n\nMPs and Ministers are increasingly saying the problem comes from the PM's office and the way in which Cabinet processes are being bypassed. \n\nMPs and senators increasingly are losing confidence in Abbott's ability to turn the situation around, Fairfax reported.","title":"PM Turnbull: change is our friend","media-type":"News","source":"Daily News","published":"2015-09-14T13:08:22Z"}

Schlatter \nDigital First Media \n   \n\n    \nNEWTOWN TOWNSHIP >> It didn\u2019t take long for the board of supervisors to go on the record with their opposition to fracking, unanimously approving a succinctly-worded resolution asking that two moratoriums banning the practice in Bucks County and the Delaware River Basin be kept in place. \n\nThe resolution, which passed by a 5-0 vote at the Sept. 9 supervisors\u2019 meeting, calls on the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) to make permanent its moratorium on shale gas development, which up until now, does not have a hard-and-fast expiration date. \n\nIn addition, the resolution asks the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to also keep in place its moratorium against issuing permits to drill for oil or natural gas in southeastern Pennsylvania. \n\nThe state\u2019s five-year moratorium on the controversial practice is set to expire on Jan. 1, 2018. \n \nVoting for the resolution were: Chairman Ryan Gallagher and Vice Chairman Mike Gallagher, as well as Supervisors Kyle Davis Phil Calabro and Jennifer Dix. \n\nCopies of the resolution will be sent to the DRBC, Gov. Tom Wolf and the state legislature asking them to support the moratoriums. \n\nAccording to the resolution, Pennsylvanians are entitled to clean air and pure water. It also claims that the state and DRBC have not conducted proper assessments of the long-term effects on hydraulic oil and natural gas drilling on residents' health and the environment. \n\nThe resolution also states: \u201cIn the absence of such assessment, it is impossible to determine whether or not shale gas development can proceed safely without creating risks to public health, property values and clean air and water.\u201d \n\nFracking opponents who packed the meeting applauded the vote, including Elizabeth Tatham of Holland. \n\n\u201cI appreciate you following up so quickly,\u201d she told the board. \u201cThank you for being proactive and this resolution will help Newtown.\u201d Continued... \n  According to the opponents, if fracking is allowed in the area it would create health, safety and environmental problems, with the top worry being groundwater contamination. \nFracking, which refers to hydraulic fracturing, is when large amounts of water or other chemicals are forced into a drilled shaft at high pressure to loosen oil, natural gas or other resources from thousands of feet underground. \n\nIf, or when, the state and DRBC moratoriums are lifted, drilling companies are expected to seek permission to drill in southeastern Pennsylvania in what is known as the South Newark Basin. \n\nThe basin includes all of Bucks County and parts of Montgomery County. \n\nHowever, at this time there are no known deposits in Newtown, Wrightstown and Upper Makefield townships, which make up the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance (JMZO), or what is commonly referred to as \u201cthe jointure.\u201d \n\nIn order to regulate where that drilling could occur in the jointure, jointure officials have drafted a 17-page ordinance limiting fracking to a zoned area in Wrightstown Township where the quarries currently are located. \n\nThe proposed ordinance was presented to the other two jointure members for consideration. \n\nCoincidentally, Wrightstown has four-areas specifically zoned for quarries and currently there is very little quarry land now available. \n\nAll three municipalities would have to pass the proposed ordinance for it to take effect. \n\nTownship solicitors have warned that if no specific areas are designated, then drilling companies could challenge municipalities in court, claiming that restrictive zoning prevents them from conducting business. Continued... \n  However, opponents argued that such an ordinance, no matter how well-intended, should not be approved, instead claiming that officials in the jointure should ban the practice outright. \nMarguerite Chandler of the Pennswood Village retirement community in Middletown Township has been fighting fracking for years. \n\nAccording to Chandler, properties which have drilling leases on them, especially those with well-water supplies, are finding it harder to get mortgages and homeowners\u2019 insurance. \n\nShe said that neighboring properties to those with leases are also negatively affected. \n\nIn addition, Chandler noted that local governments may also be responsible if a drilling company is underinsured and streams or the Delaware River watershed is contaminated for the millions of people who depend on it for drinking water. \n\nAt a July 8 meeting, anti-fracking activists had implored the Newtown supervisors to formally oppose the practice. \n\nVice Chairman Mike Gallagher had told the group that the board supported their efforts to keep fracking out not only Newtown Township, but all of Bucks County. \n\n\u201cWe're with you on this,\u201d he had said. \u201cOur job is being proactive.\u201d \n\nAnd Gallagher had explained that the proposal to relegate fracking to the Wrightstown quarries is a legal strategy that the jointure has come up with for when the moratorium is lifted. \n\n\u201cLet's figure out how we can stop fracking,\u201d Gallagher asserted. \u201cHow do we defend against the driller who wants to come in and take our natural resources?\u201d Continued... \n  Fellow supervisors agreed that they don\u2019t want oil and natural gas drilling in the township. \nMany opponents point out that New York State banned fracking after seven years of exhaustive scientific studies, concluding that it would create unsatisfactory health and safety issues. \n\nTracy Carluccio, deputy director of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, a non-profit volunteer group which helps protect the Delaware River watershed, has suggested that the DRBC should make its fracking moratorium permanent. \n\n\u201cShallow (fracked) wells are close to aquifers and will contaminate groundwater,\u201d she had stated at the July supervisors\u2019 meeting. \u201cFive percent of all wells drilled leak within five years.\u201d \n\nCarluccio attended the latest supervisors\u2019 meeting and presented the board with updated materials on fracking\u2019s alleged dangers. \n\nIn other action at the meeting, the board unanimously approved the hiring Gilmore &Associates, Inc. as the township's trail consultant. \n\nThe New Britain-based engineering firm was one of three finalists that the supervisors interviewed for the newly-created position. \n\nGilmore & Associates will be tasked to come up with a \u201cComprehensive Trail Plan\u201d to link and enhance Newtown Township\u2019s numerous trails to make them more attractive to hikers and bikers. \n\nFostering economic development and attracting recreational tourism will also key components of that plan, as is protecting the environment. \n\nOver the years, a number of the existing area trails have been developed by public and private entities, but the paths are now somewhat scattershot around the township. \n\nIn his State of the Township message in January, Supervisor Chairman Ryan Gallagher said that one of his goals for 2015 is creating a comprehensive trail strategy. \n\nAnd in a 4-1 vote, with Supervisor Dix dissenting, the board also approved hiring a company to update the township's somewhat antiquated website. \n\nFive bids were received and the Wrightstown-based AnchorMark Branding Co. was chosen to overhaul the municipal Web page, not only sprucing it up, but also providing residents with more information and linking the site to social media, including Facebook. \n\nAnchorMark bid $15,000 for the project, money which was allocated in the 2015 township budget for website improvement. \n\nOne of the planned upgrades would help the site integrate better with mobile devices, such as smartphones, which is a problem for the current website. \n\nIn addition, township forms for permits would still be available online, but there would also be a way to pay fees on the website. \n\nVideos of supervisors\u2019 meetings now posted online would also be improved. \n\nThe planned changes include allowing a person who is watching the supervisors' meeting live on a cable access channel to have the capability to go online and pull up the same Google Docs packet of public information that is on each supervisor's desktop computer. \n\nWhen completed the new website is expected to be much easier for administrators to change the information, so it could

Or maybe it was just immense pride.\n\nMammoth No. 8 Mamuka Gogordze didn't take too kindly to Georgia losing to Japan at Gloucester this month, blowing its last warm-up for the Rugby World Cup in the dying moments.\n\n\"It was a good experience against Japan because (our World Cup opener is) against Tonga, and there was a lot of Tongans on the field today.\"\n\nActually, there was only one Tongan-born starter in the Japan side and he was concussed, but that's beside the point. Gogordze wasn't finished.\n\n\"I am proud that the Georgian team is full of Georgians,\" he said. \"When I play against Canada, I don't play against Canadians. When I play against Japan, we don't play against the Japanese. Eighty per cent of their team was from New Zealand and Tonga. I am proud of my small team which is full of Georgians representing Georgia.\"\n\nHe was a little rough on Canada but not all wrong.\n\nSeven of the Japan starting side were foreign-born, including captain and flanker Michael Leitch, who was born in New Zealand but moved to Japan as a teenager. He returned to New Zealand this year to play for the Chiefs in Super Rugby.\n\nJapan has been criticized in the past for being filled with foreign-born players, but Australian-born coach Eddie Jones has worked to promote home-grown talent, while trying to keep Japan competitive. Since the 2011 Rugby World Cup, he's added only five players through residency.\n\nBut eligibility remains a hot topic, whether players qualify by three-year residency or a grandparent in the distant past. World Rugby said it is reviewing the rules, but it's not hard to imagine it will remain controversial.\n\nCoach Vern Cotter stirred up Scotland when he picked John Hardie, who qualified thanks to a Scottish grandmother, in the Rugby World Cup only five weeks after he arrived from New Zealand and with 57 minutes of international playing time. That might have been fine, but Hardie was chosen at the expense of regular Blair Cowan and John Barclay, who had just come out of a two-year exile.\n\nHardie calmed the critics, somewhat, with a second good show in the loss to France in Paris in the final warm-up.\n\nFour years ago, Argentina, Georgia, and Romania had entirely homegrown teams.\n\nThis year, only Argentina does.\n\nGeorgia has only one foreign-born player, centre Merab Sharikadze, born in Russia to Georgian parents who returned home.\n\nRomania has five, after the Oaks decided to beef up in search of their first quarterfinal. Three of the players qualified on residency this year, all of them aged around 30.\n\nNew Zealand-born flyhalf Mike Wiringi received a cap in June, and South African-born lock Johannes van Heerden and Tongan-born centre Paula Kinikinilau made their debuts less than two weeks ago in the home loss to Tonga.\n\nSamoa tops the list with the most foreign-born players with 15, all from neighbour New Zealand, after prop Census Johnston came out of retirement as an injury replacement last week for his third World Cup.\n\nTonga was next with 12, including nine Kiwis with Tongan parents, followed by Scotland and Wales with 11 each.\n\nScotland included South African-born No. 8 Josh Strauss, even though he doesn't qualify on residency until Friday, when the tournament starts.\n\nThe next highest with 10 each were Japan, and France, which has picked four on residency since the last World Cup.\n\nOn nine were Australia, Italy, and the United States, which used to be at the lower end of the list, but has included three players this year on residency alone.\n\nNew Zealand, often accused of pillaging the Pacific Islands, led a group with five, including Ireland, Canada, and Romania. Only two All Blacks were born in the Pacific islands: Malakai Fekitoa (Tonga), and Waisake Naholo (Fiji), while five more were of Samoan descent.\n\nThe list finished with England (3), Fiji (2), Namibia (2), South Africa (1), and Uruguay (1).","title":"3 Six Nations sides among the top-6 teams with most foreign-born players at Rugby World Cup","media-type":"News","source":"Brandon Sun","published":"2015-09-15T21:40:50Z"}

(Photo: Streeter Lecka, ) \n\nIs the Big Ten starting to look like the SEC that once won seven consecutive BCS championships? \n\nESPN's Ryan McGee thinks so -- and the first piece of evidence he points to is No. 4 Michigan State's 31-28 victory over then-No. 7 Oregon on Saturday at Spartan Stadium. \n\nBut a quick glance at the rest of the conference shows the Big Ten is trending up entering Week 3 of the college football season. \n\nOhio State is the defending national champion and still No. 1. Michigan earned its first win of the Jim Harbaugh era in convincing fashion, albeit against a young, inexperienced Oregon State squad. \n\n\"Minnesota rallied to beat Colorado State in OT. Iowa broke away from a tie game to defeat Iowa State. Wisconsin and Northwestern eased into the lower regions of the AP Top 25,\" McGee added. \n\n\"All of this took place while the SEC's bus caught fire. Auburn won embarrassingly in OT over FCS opponent Jacksonville State, and Arkansas lost embarrassingly to Big Ten backyard little brother Toledo. Then the self-cannibalization of the SEC West began in Starkville, Mississippi, on Saturday night with LSU's two-point win over Mississippi State. Meanwhile, the SEC East already looks like it's still the same old spaghetti pile it has been for the past decade.\" \n\nMcGee argues the SEC went on its 7-year run from 2007-13 thanks to a dependable model each season: The SEC had 1-2 dominant teams each year, enough inferior teams such as Vanderbilt, Kentucky and Tennessee\u00a0to ensure conference victories, at least one big cross-conference win and a win in the conference championship game. That formula usually ensured the SEC earned a berth in the BCS Championship Game. \n\nHe sees the same thing happening in the Big Ten -- with the Buckeyes and Spartans being the dominant teams. \n\n\"For Ohio State and Michigan State, the road looks familiar,\" McGee wrote.\u00a0\"The high-profile Power 5 wins are out of the way (thank you Hokies and Ducks). Now the goal will be to survive mid-fall without a letdown, bulldozing the bad teams (Indiana, Maryland, Rutgers, Purdue, take your pick) and knocking out good-but-not-great, big-brand-name opponents (Michigan and Nebraska for MSU, Penn State and Minnesota for OSU) before the Nov. 21 showdown in Columbus, Ohio.\" \n\nBuckle up, Spartans fans: You have quite an exciting fall ahead. \n\nContact Brian Manzullo: bmanzullo@freepress.com.

The company is fronted by two social-media-savvy beefcakes who often take to YouTube to hawk and explain their company\u2019s wares. But Arizona-based Nutrition Distribution, a supplement company that competes with Blackstone, claimed in an April lawsu it (filed in California) that the Florida company was trying to pass off products as \u201cnatural supplements\u201d when they actually included \u201cillegal synthetic ingredients .\u201d \n\nNow, the legal action is heating up, with the competitor again claiming Blackstone is deceiving clients and flouting regulation. This month, lawyers asked a California judge to sign an injunction against the sale of one particular chemical that hasn\u2019t even been approved for human use \u2014 a Blackstone product called Ostapure. \n\nIn promotional material and videos featuring the company\u2019s two owners and frontmen, P.J. Braun and Aaron Singerman, the company trumpeted Ostapure\u2019s usefulness for gym rats looking to swell up. \u201cOstapure has the same anabolic effect as testosterone without any of the adverse side effects that come from its use,\u201d one of the owners says in a YouTube video. \u201cWhen using Ostapure on a diet, you don\u2019t have to worry about shrinking or flattening out while losing body fat. In fact, you\u2019ll stay strong in the gym, keep your pumps, and maintain your sex drive.\u201d \n\n[embedded content] \n\nAccording to Nutrition Distribution, though, Ostapure\u2019s active ingredient, Ostarine, hasn\u2019t been green-lit for human consumption. The drug is still going through trials, meaning \u201cThe sale of Ostarine over the counter without comprehensive evidence of its safety puts the public in significant danger,\u201d the Blackstone competitor claims in court filings. \n\nBoth Ostarine and Ostapure are prohibited for use in sporting events by the World Anti-Doping Agency. \u201cI was surprised to learn that Blackstone markets Ostarine as an over-the-counter steroid, promising huge muscle gains with no side effects,\u201d Dr. Feliciano Serrano, an expert witness for Nutrition Distribution, wrote in an affidavit. \u201cOstarine has many side effects that we know of, and possibly more that we are unaware of, since there have never been comprehensive safety studies on humans.\u201d \n\nOstarine is currently in phase II clinical trials conducted by its developer, Gtx Inc., for treating breast cancer and osteoporosis. \u201cThe fact that Ostarine is only in phase II trial means that there is no evidence that Ostarine is safe for humans to consume,\u201d Serrano writes in his affidavit. \u201cOstarine has many recognized potential side effects, including hepatoxicity (liver damage), and markedly lower plasma HDL cholesterol (raising the risk of heart disease). Ostarine also has less serious side effects including headaches, back pain, and diarrhea.\u201d \n\nBlackstone isn\u2019t the only place you can get your hands on Ostarine. You can also purchase the active pharmaceutical ingredient \u2013 MK-2866 Ostarine \u2013 from a website called HardcorePeptides.com . And this isn\u2019t the only heavy-duty drug you can scoop up from the website \u2013 we\u2019re talking about the stuff you\u2019d expect to only be able to get through a doctor. \n\nIn addition to Ostarine, HardcorePeptides.com sells Pramipexole , a drug used to treat Parkingson\u2019s; Ketotifen , commonly used to treat asthma; clomiphene , an estrogen receptor modulator common in fertility treatments; exemestane , a drug used to treat breast cancer; and sildenafil , known more commonly in the bedrooms of America as Viagra. \n\nThis site is able to sell these drugs apparently because it claims to be a \u201cpeptide & research chemical supply company\u201d that features products \u201csold for research purposes only.\u201d Yet in the lawsuit claims the website was yet another \u201cscheme to sell pharmaceuticals to bobybuilders\u201d linked to the Blackstone crowd. \n\nHardcorePeptides parent company \u2013 Hardcore Ventures LLC \u2013 is incorporated in Washington state. Records list an \u201cAaron Singerman\u201d as an officer of the company. Also, the lawsuit alleges that \u201cBlackstone helps funnel its bobybuilding customers to Hardcore Peptides by inputting the customer\u2019s data on Hardcore Peptides marketing listserv.\u201d The Blackstone Labs\u2019 Facebook account has also advertised sales on the Hardcore Peptides sites. \n\nThe injunction petition will be ruled on in the fall. Nutrition Distribution\u2019s attorney declined to comment on the latest filings. Blackstone Labs did not return a message left at the office last week seeking comment. Attorneys representing the company also did not reply to an email seeking comment.\u00a0","title":"Lawsuit: Blackstone Labs Is Selling Unsafe Supplement, Ostarine","media-type":"News","source":"Broward Palm Beach","published":"2015-09-23T13:00:00Z"}

Hamilton appeared to give Rosberg little room at the second turn, forcing the German partially off the track. \n \n\"I didn't think it was that close,\" Hamilton said. \"The inside line is the inside line, so it was my corner.\" \n \nRosberg was reserving judgment until he saw the incident on replay. \n \n\"It was a pity to do that on the start,\" Rosberg said. \"We battled around Turns 1 and 2. It got very close on the exit at Turn 2 and I had to back out and that cost me the race.\" \n \nWith Hamilton comfortably ahead throughout the grand prix, the focus shifted to the tight battle for second place between Rosberg and Vettel. \n \nFerrari elected to wait until Rosberg pitted before bringing in Vettel, and that proved critical. Even though Vettel's stop was four tenths of a second faster than Rosberg's, the Mercedes driver's lap on fresh rubber was enough to get him just ahead of Vettel, and that's how it stayed. \n \n\"I tried everything,\" Vettel said. \"The tyres were on the limit - not more that I could have done.\" \n \nVettel's Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen was fourth followed by Williams' Valtteri Bottas. \n \nThe podium positions were exactly the same as last year's race at Suzuka which was marred by a crash involving Jules Bianchi, who died in July, having never regained consciousness. \n \n\"This is a circuit that I can honestly say I've struggled at through all the years I've come here,\" Hamilton said. \"But it's one that I've loved driving at...so you really want to come here and dominate at this track.\" \n \nForce India's Niko Hulkenberg was sixth while the Lotus pair of Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado finished seventh and eighth, giving the financially strapped team a confidence boost. \n \nToro Rosso's Max Verstappen - in his last race as a 17-year-old - was ninth ahead of his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. \n \nBoth Red Bull cars finished outside the top 10. Daniil Kvyat started from the pits, while Daniel Ricciardo had a tire-bumping duel with Williams' Felipe Massa soon after the start, leaving both with punctures that forced them to pit after one lap. \n    \nThe next race is the Russian GP in Sochi on October 11.","title":"Hamilton powers to Japanese GP win","media-type":"News","source":"Dominion Post","published":"2015-09-29T05:07:33Z"}

Chinese travelers can do the same in the U.S. using Didi's app. \n\nTravelers will be able to take advantage of the deal in early 2016. \n\nAnd there are millions who will potentially do so. According to Lyft, nearly 8 million people traveled between China and the U.S. in 2014. \n\n\"Our vision was never just about the United States,\" said Lyft cofounder John Zimmer in a press conference announcing the partnership. \"It's just the start.\" \n\nThe announcement puts both firms in a better position to take on Uber, which is pouring resources into Asia, particularly China and India. \n\nBoth Zimmer and Didi President Jean Liu seem confident in their two-against-one approach. \n\nZimmer said Lyft's business is \"stronger than ever and that the company's business in New York City alone has tripled over the past few months. \n\nLiu called the deal the marker of a \"brand new era for the global ride-sharing industry.\" \n\nDidi Kuaidi -- which offers everything from black cars and bus services to taxis and ridesharing -- closed a $3 billion round just last week. \n\nThe partnership isn't all that surprising. Earlier this year, Didi invested $100 million into Lyft as part of its latest $530 million funding round, which was led by Japanese e-commerce firm Rakuten. \n\nLyft is valued at $2.5 billion, according to CB Insights. Uber's valuation, on the other hand, is $51 billion. \n\nBut according to Liu, Uber has far from won the battle. \n\n\"People don't realize that ridesharing is still in its infancy,\" she said. \"We will be able to push the evolution of this industry to the next level.\" \n\nThat involves sharing best practices, market knowledge and technology. The partnership will also help with the regulatory hurdles that typically go along with entering new markets. \n\nZimmer did not respond to questions during the Q&A about whether Lyft would partner with other ridesharing companies in markets like India.","title":"Uber rivals band together to form U.S.-China alliance","media-type":"News","source":"KWCH 12","published":"2015-09-17T06:07:15Z"}

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. \n\nCrush the granola \n\n1. Pour the granola into a zip-top bag, removing most of the air before sealing. \n\n2. Use a rolling pin to crush the granola until it has the consistency of breadcrumbs. Spread it onto a plate and set aside. \n\nPound out the chicken \n\n1.

Use a fork to crush the berries and mix them into the goat cheese until mostly smooth and well-combined. \n\n5. Sprinkle the chicken with the salt and pepper, then spread the goat cheese mixture on all but the top 1-1\/2 inches of the chicken. \n\n6. Starting at the bottom, roll up the chicken into a log, ending with the edge that doesn't have any goat cheese on it. \n\n7. Melt the butter in an oven-safe saut\u00e9 pan set over medium-high heat. \n\n8. Carefully lift the chicken and dip it first into the egg wash, letting any excess drip off, and then into the granola, pressing the granola onto all sides of the chicken. \n\n9. Place the chicken in the saut\u00e9 pan and cook for 2 minutes. \n\n10. Use a wide spatula to carefully turn the chicken over, then put the pan in the oven. Bake for 7 minutes, or until a thermometer inserted in the center reads 165 degrees. \n\n11. Remove the pan from the oven and tent a piece of aluminum foil over the pan for 5 minutes to allow the chicken time to rest. \n\n12. Slice and serve. \n\nFor the slaw \n\n1. Combine all of the slaw ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. \n\n2.

(BlackRock), announced the launch of two new iShares strategic fixed income ETFs to help generate income for investors while addressing sensitivity to interest rate volatility. Building on the success of the iShares Short Term Strategic Fixed Income ETF (XSI) -- which launched earlier this year and has attracted the largest inflows of any new Canadian ETF in 2015(2) -- the iShares Conservative Short Term Strategic Fixed Income ETF (XSC) and the iShares Conservative Strategic Fixed Income ETF (XSE) will provide investors with a model-driven suite of fixed income ETFs. \n\n\"We listened to our clients and are moving to meet their needs. The success of XSI demonstrates that investors are eager for fixed income solutions to help generate income, mitigate duration risk and navigate an uncertain interest rate environment,\" said Pat Chiefalo, Managing Director, Head of Canadian Product for BlackRock's iShares business. \"These two new funds, in combination with XSI, offer a full range of fixed income solutions, delivering investors access to BlackRock's global iShares platform.\" \n\nBuilding a Model-Driven Fixed Income Suite: Generating Yield Amidst Interest Rate Volatility \n\nLike XSI, XSC and XSE have been designed to respond to the realities that fixed income investors face in today's marketplace. Amidst the shifts around sustainable economic growth prospects, central banks continue to pursue - or maintain - low interest rate policies, making the search for yield a continued challenge. \n\nXSI responded to these market conditions by offering investors a strategic, model-driven fixed income ETF aimed at generating yield while managing the uncertain interest rate outlook. Amidst continued economic shifts, investors have indicated a desire for additional fixed income solutions that can meet the needs of investors operating within the boundaries of a lower risk profile. These two new products are expected to appeal to an investor with a relatively 'conservative' risk profile through limiting their total exposure to high yield securities to 25% of each fund's respective portfolio upon rebalancing. Both new products, like XSI, draw upon the full breadth and depth of BlackRock's global iShares platform, enabling investors to gain unique access to otherwise hard-to-reach international exposures such as emerging markets corporate bonds. \n\n\"Investors recognize that the current trends in monetary policy and historically low interest rates cannot last forever,\" said Aubrey Basdeo, Managing Director, Head of Canadian Fixed Income, BlackRock. \"The Bank of Canada's decision yesterday to maintain interest rates only reinforces the \"low for longer\" yield outlook in domestic bond portfolios. To overcome this income challenge, some investors may want to consider alternative fixed income strategies with international exposures to generate additional yield. XSI has helped address this investor demand, and XSC and XSE will provide investors with even greater optionality.\" \n\nXSC and XSE will invest primarily in securities or ETFs that provide exposure to Canadian and international fixed income securities. Both funds will seek to hedge any resulting U.S. dollar or other foreign currency exposure, as applicable, back to Canadian dollars. XSC will also upon rebalancing, generally limit its exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a portfolio duration of less than five years. The management fees will be 0.40% for XSC and 0.50% for XSE. \n\nStructured as a \"fund of funds\", XSC and XSE will, like XSI, leverage BlackRock's global iShares platform. XSC and XSE will directly hold funds that provide exposure to both domestic and international fixed income securities that Canadian investors might otherwise have difficulty accessing. The diversification capabilities of these funds allow for rebalancing of exposures as the fixed income landscape fluctuates, in order to continue to limit interest rate sensitivity (as well as country-specific risk) and enhance opportunities for greater yield. \n\nFurther information on the iShares Funds can be found at www.blackrock.com\/ca.

But what sets THIS one apart is the effort the criminals went to try to access a business. \n \nAround 5:30am Sunday morning, Kennewick police responded to an alarm at the Traffic Jams store at 525 North Edison street. \n \nUpon arrival they found evidence that a suspect, or suspects, had tried to access the store by cutting or breaking through a wall from the business next door , A Different Shade Window tinting. \n \nThe suspects broke into the Different Shade facility, then were in the process of breaking through the wall when their would-be \u201cdemolition\u201d efforts made the Traffic Jams alarm go off.

{"id":"88e3d4c9-c112-473a-95af-ed316a07e486","content":"After availing themselves to much media manipulation and to political machinations, women in Egypt are back in a very familiar place and one where they have been before. The state is paying lip service to their rights but dismantling their abilities to mobilise.\n\nWomen are present but in retreat! By women, I mean the women\u2019s movement. By retreat I refer to the deflation of a dynamism that saw women contesting, protesting, challenging and forming alliances and its replacement with a rather flaccid support for a strong state that is the champion and protector of women.\n\nThe state has delivered on many of its promises to women. The creation of specialist anti-harassment units in the Ministry of Interior was in response to a women\u2019s movement lobby and is an important step towards safer streets.\n\nThe president spoke out against sexual harassment by visiting one of the savagely attacked victims during the presidential election celebrations and urged the government to issue a harsh harassment law. By so doing he became the first head of state to recognise and condemn such savage attacks. But there have also been other gains made on behalf of women.\n\nThe quota for women in local councils is perhaps the most significant attainment realised by women and one that can potentially change the political structures of Egypt. The 2014 constitution mandates the election of at least 13,000 thousand women to local councils.\n\nAt a more symbolic level we find more gains. The Ministry of Justice has recently appointed a female deputy minister and has confirmed the entry of women into the judiciary in response to long standing demands from women\u2019s groups.\n\nWomen have also been celebrated as the loyal and trustworthy allies of the state. They stood firm against \u2018ikhwanisation\u2019 (Muslim Brotherhood influence) and mobilised in their millions to approve the constitution of 2014 and vote for the current president and as such are lauded and celebrated, or at least some of them are!\n\nOn the other hand and in contrast to symbolic or substantive gestures of gender justice, there have been systematic negations of women\u2019s rights. At the formal level, evidence can be found in the neglect of the National Council for Women. The term of the current council ended in March 2015. The deliberations for selecting a new national council for women have taken place in closed circles and have not yet yielded a new council.\n\nThe council is comprised of a head and 29 members. The selection of these women and men is happening through personal nominations of \u2018trusted insiders\u2019 and filtered through the routine and excessive security and executive checks. There may well be 30 amazing people who have been selected but the process by which this organ of state feminism is being built is essentially antithetical to the idea of accountable, representative or transparent national machinery.\n\nMeanwhile, women\u2019s organisations have suffered as collateral damage as a result of the stringent civil society restrictions and regulations that have targeted human rights work. Their ability to organise and mobilise is curtailed and their funds have been diminished. Women in political parties who were instrumental in organising the 30th of June 2015 demonstrations and sit- ins are also challenged by the dysfunctional state of their parties.\n\nWomen have been here before! A century ago women began to mobilise and form a united front to gain basic rights but it was the post 1952 revolution regime that gave them these rights as a presidential gift and not in response to political pressure. Once again, the state is recognising some rights of women but curtailing the ability of a women\u2019s movement to make claims or to pressure for change or recognition. \n\nOnce again the state is approaching issues of gender justice and of women\u2019s rights as a set of formal or institutional arrangements that are peppered with slogans and symbolic gestures. \n\nEgypt may well have a 30 member NCW, a women\u2019s department in the police force, 13,000 women elected as local council members, a few female judges, a lot of lip service being paid to the \u201cGreat Egyptian Woman\u201d, and some prominent women who are present in the public sphere and who use themselves as evidence of the high regard in which women are held by polity and by society. But none of these structures or symbols will matter if there isn\u2019t a vibrant, veritable and free movement to guard any gains, hold power to account and represent the interests and realities of women.\n\nThe state cannot be a substitute for society or expropriate civil space in the name of paternalism or protection. The National Council for women is not a proxy for women as a whole. It is simply a machinery dedicated to the cause of gender equality and not a tool to sequester women\u2019s voices.\n\nHopefully the new council will honour this responsibility and build on the strong voice and presence of the current (and now elapsed) NCW leadership.","title":"The trouble with women in Egypt!","media-type":"News","source":"Al Ahram","published":"2015-09-13T16:08:28Z"}

He will point to the shrinking ice, rising sea levels, land erosion, and melting permafrost as evidence that the world must act to reduce greenhouse emissions. \n \nAlaska is bearing the brunt of climate change worse than other parts of the world. \u201cThis is an issue that is very here and now,\u201d Brian Deese, a top climate advisor to Obama, told reporters ahead of the President\u2019s visit. \u201cThe issue of climate change is not an issue of the future tense in Alaska. It is affecting people in their lives and livelihoods in real ways.\u201d \n \nAt the same time, not too far from his visit, is a major Arctic oil project that his administration just approved, underscoring the contradictions within the U.S. government about fossil fuel production and the need to address climate change. \n \nRelated:\u00a0Eni Announces Supergiant Gas Discovery Off Egyptian Coast \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent on the one hand for President Obama to lead the world toward comprehensive action on climate change, while on the other allowing companies to pursue difficult, expensive oil in dangerous and remote places,\u201d Michael LeVine, senior counsel for environmental group Oceana, told the New York Times . \n \nThe timing is indeed a bit awkward. Royal Dutch Shell is in the midst of drilling campaign in the Chukchi Sea, which Obama\u2019s Interior Department recently green-lighted. Shell has a tight window in which to drill. By the time Shell\u2019s icebreaker completed repairs in Portland, OR, managed to navigate through Greenpeace protestors , and arrived on site, Shell was left with little margin for error. The Anglo-Dutch company will essentially have just August and September to drill in the Burger prospect, before it has to shut operations down for the winter. \n \nAcknowledging his approval of Shell\u2019s drilling plans, Obama argued in his weekly radio address that he wants the nation to move beyond fossil fuels \u2013 in Anchorage on Monday he called for aggressive action on climate change \u2013 but that in the interim, while the nation is still hooked on oil and gas, it would be better to produce domestically than to import. \n \nRelated:\u00a0Could Oil Sink Below $40 Per Barrel Again? \n \nThere is strong environmental opposition to Arctic drilling, and protests were held in Anchorage in response to Obama\u2019s visit. But there is also a lot of pressure at the state level to expand oil and gas drilling in Alaska. At issue is the state\u2019s overwhelming dependence on oil production for its economy, and state revenues have been battered by the twin calamities of falling oil production and collapsing prices. Moreover, the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, which runs 800 miles from Alaska\u2019s North Slope to the state\u2019s southern coast, is running dry due to falling oil production. Oil flows in the pipeline are declining by about 5 percent per year. \n \n\u201cWe have an oil pipeline that\u2019s two-thirds empty,\u201d Alaska\u2019s Governor Bill Walker, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to predict what will or won\u2019t happen, but as governor I can\u2019t take that chance. Right now, about 75 percent of our revenue comes from that oil pipeline.\u201d To make matters worse, the pipeline becomes more difficult to operate when oil flows drop below a certain level. More pump stations will likely be needed to keep up pipeline pressure if oil flows fall below 300,000 barrels per day. Thus, for the Alaskan government, declining oil production is an urgent problem. \u201cI think that he\u2019ll have a better appreciation when he\u2019s up here, kind of what the need is in Alaska,\u201d the state\u2019s governor said. \n \nRelated:\u00a0Why So Much Oil Price Volatility? Blame The Speculators \n \nMeanwhile, Shell is facing some pretty harsh conditions in the Arctic. On August 28, the company was forced to halt drilling operations because of high winds. But even if Shell is successful with its drilling operations in the Chukchi Sea, the company doesn\u2019t expect to bring oil online until the end of the next decade. \n \nTaking all of these competing interests into account, the President is trying to pull off a tough balancing act. But another factor to consider is the possibility that the White House is losing enthusiasm for Arctic drilling behind the scenes, even while the administration approved Shell\u2019s permits and the President continues to justify his government\u2019s actions. The National Journal reported on August 28 that the Interior Department has not started work on the environmental assessment for the Arctic drilling leases that it is expected to auction off in 2016. \n \nSince that process can take two years to complete, there appears to be a growing possibility that the auction could be delayed or cancelled. If that were to happen, any new acreage would not be sold until the next administration. And if the next President is a Democrat, Arctic drilling could be shelved altogether given the candidates\u2019 outspoken opposition to the idea. \n \nBy Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.com \n \nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com: \n \nJoin the discussion","title":"Obama\u2019s Balancing Act: Climate Change And Arctic Drilling","media-type":"News","source":"OilPrice.com","published":"2015-08-31T21:24:32Z"}
